- sb 18 xx ( burton ) , sb 78 xx ( polanco ) , ab 82 xx ( keeley ) and ab 83 xx ( wright ) - - are still "" in play "" legislatively this evening , even though the governor told the dow jones newswire earlier today that the proposals are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the assembly and senate to stay in session ( despite the scheduled summer break ) until a bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to him for signature : * sb 78 xx ( polanco ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 passed out of the full senate on friday with 22 ayes and 17 noes . the originally introduced version of sb 78 xx reflected the terms of the original memorandum of understanding ( "" mou "" ) negotiated between governor davis and southern california edison ( "" edison "" ) . it was recently amended to reflect senator sher ' s proposed "" plan b "" of the mou - - a version of the mou opposed by edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave edison creditworthy . it was heard in the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on wednesday where it failed on a 4 ayes and 3 noes vote . reconsideration was granted , however , and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 ayes and 2 noes on thursday morning . the authors took up amendments such as striking the urgency clause , changing the rate component from 125 kws to 500 kws , placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting section 399 . 26 ( which insulated edison international from certain claims ) during the thursday hearing . sb 78 xx was then passed out of the senate appropriations committee on thursday with 7 ayes and 3 noes . * sb 18 xx ( burton ) department of water resources : electricity : bond financing order passed out of the full senate on friday with 35 ayes and 2 noes , making it possible for dwr to issue bonds at a lower , cheaper rate than allotted in ab lx ( keeley ) assuming the assembly concurs and the bill is signed by governor davis . the bill also prohibits any additional charges such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the legislature and requires certain "" sunshine "" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts entered to by the dwr . we understand that j . p . morgan and lehman brothers - - the firms working with state treasurer angelides on the bond offering - - have advised the governor ' s office that sb 18 xx could delay the issuance of the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons , so it is unclear whether this bill will ever be signed . the bill was heard by the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on thursday where it passed with a 10 ayes and 0 noes vote . it next must be heard in the assembly . * ab 82 xx ( keeley ) electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 passed out of assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening on a 11 ayes and 9 noes vote . it was then heard later the same evening by the assembly appropriations committee , where it was passed on a 11 ayes and 6 noes vote . this is the "" compromise "" bill we have been discussing all week authored by speaker hertzberg and assembly member fred keeley . the bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this report , with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by the full assembly , possibly later this evening . the current version of the bill provides for limited direct access , state purchase of edison ' s transmission lines for $ 2 . 4 billion , a minimum 30 percent "" haircut "" for the major generators and a "" trust "" to cover all claims not dealt with by the haircut option . * ab 83 xx ( wright ) alternative electric utility rate stabilization act of 2001 was amended into ab 50 xx ( by assembly member bill campbell ) in the assembly energy costs and availability committee wednesday evening , and then passed out of committee with 11 ayes and 9 noes . it next must be heard by the assembly appropriations committee , barring a rule waiver . no such committee hearing is scheduled at this time . co - authored by assembly members rod wright , keith richman , joe canciamilla and bill campbell , the bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address the net undercollection , among other things . other energy - related developments this week include : * sb 84 xx ( burton ) state energy resources conservation and development commission passed out of the full senate on friday with 30 ayes and 1 no and sent to the assembly . this bill provides $ 10 million from the state general fund to the california energy commission ( "" cec "" ) to fund a matching grant program for a battery backup power source for led traffic signals . the grant program will be administered by the cec , in consultation with local governments , and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup system . it next must be heard in the assembly . * the ferc is expected to consider disbanding the current iso board for an independent slate of directors on wednesday , the ferc announced on friday . despite a dec 15 , 2000 , ferc order requiring the appointment of an independent governing board for the iso , the state has refused to follow the order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of the board . supporters of the ferc order argue that political appointees should not oversee power markets due to the state ' s domineering role in purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities . * sb 85 xx ( burton ) electrical restructuring : rates passed out of the full senate on thursday with 37 ayes and 0 noes . this bill bars the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) from raising rates back to the pre - 10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate reduction period has expired on march 31 , 2002 . it next must be heard in the assembly . * the senate gave authorization to the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation on thursday to subpoena top energy company executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies ' trading practices . the resolution - - sr 14 - - passed out with 28 ayes and 6 noes . * the senate select committee to investigate market manipulation voted unanimously on wednesday to ask the full senate to find texas - based reliant energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents . despite reliant ' s having handed over 10 , 000 documents , the committee rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentiality of reliant ' s documents . the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against enron after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in texas . mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents . the contempt citation against reliant will be presented to the full senate , and then immediately sent to the rules committee for another hearing before the full senate acts , dunn said . * the state ' s estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped from $ 8 . 9 billion to $ 6 . 1 billion after a ferc judge ordered a readjustment in the state ' s figure on wednesday . although the state continues to argue that the $ 8 . 9 billion figure is correct , ferc judge curtis wagner called the figure "" baseless "" and criticized the california delegation for "" not negotiating in good faith "" during the recent settlement discussions . the new amount , $ 6 . 1 billion , does not include power sales to municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers - - two entities that do not fall under the purview of the iso , px or the state dwr - - as well as applies ferc price controls imposed june 19 and retroactively takes into account sales from october 2 onward . * ab 28 xx ( migden ) electrical restructuring : oversight board : iso passed out of the senate energy , utilities and communications committee on tuesday to senate appropriations with 7 ayes and 0 noes . it was amended by the author in committee to "" double - join "" it to sb 39 xx ( see below ) . this amendment "" ties "" the ultimate fate of ab 28 xx to the fate of ab 39 xx , unless the double - joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the governor for signature , assuming the bill gets to the governor . * sb 39 xx ( speier ) public utilities failed to pass out of the assembly energy costs and availability committee on tuesday with 7 ayes and 10 noes . reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to the author . given the failure of sb 39 xx in committee , ab 28 xx is effectively "" dead "" as well for the moment ( see discussion of ab 28 xx above . ) best regards , tom mcmorrow and mike martinez > -

  beberg@mithral.com-----------------Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and BytesBy Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
can't get the chicks with that anymore.""The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job.""Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation.""Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along.""Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""

The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
of the speakers choice.Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
pretty weak."

Yes it was there.
You guessed the problem correctly in an earlier e-mail There was still
remnants remaining from an old failed avifile installation.

their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I
wanted....................................

"" the move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the houston energy - trading concern in the past 10 days . enron is the nation ' s largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . yesterday , for example , enron was involved in about $ 4 billion of deals through its enrononline unit . since early last week , enron ' s share price has plummeted 50 % . last week , it reported a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $ 1 . 2 billion . it also disclosed that the securities and exchange commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was replaced wednesday . the draw - down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency , fitch , put enron on review for a possible downgrade , while another , standard it takes time to sell assets , particularly in today ' s slower economy . the company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility , particularly in connection with its dealings with mr . fastow , the former chief financial officer . internal documents related to one of the fastow partnerships disclose that enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official , who has since left enron . while enron disclosed its fastow - related transactions in sec filings , a computerized search of the sec ' s database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee - related entity known as chewco . chewco was established in 1997 "" with approximately $ 400 million in capital commitments "" to buy an interest in enron assets , according to one of the partnerships documents . the document didn ' t further specify what assets were purchased , and it didn ' t disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either chewco or enron . chewco was being run by michael kopper , a managing director in enron ' s global equity markets group , according to the document . enron , which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee - related entities were legal and properly disclosed , didn ' t have any comment regarding its dealings with chewco . mr . kopper , who enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the fastow - related partnerships , didn ' t return phone calls . a person at his office in houston yesterday said mr . kopper was traveling . in response to questions about chewco , an enron spokesman would say only that "" michael kopper was never an executive officer of enron . "" mr . fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests . he severed his relationships with the partnerships in july . this statement is an apparent reference to sec disclosure regulations regarding related - party transactions . under sec rule s - k , a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $ 60 , 000 and involves "" any director or executive officer . "" by contrast , mr . fastow , as cfo , would have fallen into that category , but mr . kopper , as managing director of a business unit , presumably wouldn ' t have . however , reporting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board seems to have a broader definition , one that might include mr . kopper . according to fas statement 57 , a related - party transaction involves a "" material "" piece of business between the company and a member of management . the statement defines management as directors , top officers , vice presidents in charge of major business units and "" other persons who perform similar policy - making functions . persons without formal titles may also be members of management .

"" many sales by enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises . strong selling by company officers and directors amid share - price declines should raise red flags for investors , says jonathan moreland , research director of insiderinsights . com , who uses insider - trading data to zero in on investment ideas . among other insiders selling during the year , kenneth rice , former chairman and ceo of enron ' s broadband unit , sold shares for $ 23 . 7 million . mr . rice has sold 456 , 966 shares of the 1 . 5 million shares he was listed as owning in enron ' s march proxy filing . former enron chief executive jeffrey skilling - - who resigned in august - - sold 160 , 000 shares for $ 9 . 8 million during the year . in march , mr . skilling owned 1 . 9 million shares . messrs . rice and skilling couldn ' t be reached to comment . overall , enron ' s insiders were busier selling shares last year , when they sold 5 . 8 million shares for about $ 449 million . during 1999 , insiders sold 3 . 4 million shares for $ 123 . 1 million . since december 1999 , only one enron executive has reported buying company shares . the buyer was andrew fastow , who was ousted during the week as enron ' s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a securities and exchange commission investigation into financial ties between the company and mr . fastow . mr . fastow reported purchasing 10 , 000 enron shares in august at $ 36 . 98 each , or a total of $ 369 , 800 . today , those shares are valued at $ 163 , 500 , based on enron ' s stock price of $ 16 . 35 in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading . after the purchase , mr . fastow owned 110 , 586 shares , thomson financial / lancer analytics says . enron said mr . fastow wasn ' t available to comment . on monday , a new york law firm filed suit in u . s . district court in houston , alleging that enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by mr . fastow . the suit , which seeks class - action status , also says enron insiders sold $ 73 million of their own enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . credit markets enron ' s financial troubles reverberate to bonds with poor liquidity and credit - rating concerns by jathon sapsford and suzanne mcgee staff reporters of the wall street journal 10 / 26 / 2001 the wall street journal cl 5 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . ) new york - - enron corp . ' s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy - trading powerhouse . not for long , some bond traders say . in trading yesterday , the houston company ' s five - year bond , a $ 250 million issue due in july 2006 carrying a coupon of 6 . 4 % , was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar , down from a bid of 88 late wednesday , and representing a 16 % drop during the past two weeks . that is far less than the 50 % decline in enron ' s stock price since the oct . 16 disclosure of a $ 1 . 01 billion charge linked to soured investments , resulting in a $ 618 million third - quarter loss . but the fall in the bond ' s price translates to a yield of 7 . 7 percentage points above bellwether u . s . government bonds , which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago . although enron still is an investment - grade credit , that kind of "" spread "" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single b or lower . enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound , disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $ 1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances . yet even as enron was tapping its lifeline , investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of enron bonds . yesterday ' s 82 bid , for instance , was for a block of less than $ 2 million in bonds , a small percentage of a typical trade . fueling the uncertainty surrounding enron were fears that credit - rating concerns will lower ratings on enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles , including losses , a securities and exchange commission investigation , and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer . "" even at these levels , there ' s very little buying interest , "" said harold rivkin , a principal at distressed - debt trader h . rivkin & co . in princeton , n . j . in one sign of the ripple effects , the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on enron debt was surging . the cost of a "" default swap "" - - in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default - - rose to 10 % of the size of the credit being insured . that was up from 8 % a day earlier , and more than holders of lucent technologies inc . debt had to pay at the height of that technology company ' s troubles earlier during the year . even with its woes , enron remains an investment - grade company . most credit - rating agencies rate enron ' s senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment - grade level . yet fitch said yesterday it put enron ' s credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade , following a similar move by moody ' s investors service last week . ( standard & poor ' s , a division of mcgraw hill cos . , stopped short of putting the company on its creditwatch list , opting instead to revise its long - term ratings outlook to "" negative , "" citing concerns about the company ' s financial flexibility . ) meanwhile , the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst . "" these are investment - grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels , "" said glenn reynolds , an analyst at credit sights inc . , an independent fixed - income research firm in new york . "" they aren ' t distressed yet , but they are headed in that direction . "" if enron ' s credit ratings fall , it would have implications far beyond the company ' s ability to raise money . for an energy trader , a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments . enron makes markets in a variety of commodities . though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas , the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber , metals , bandwidth capacity and steel . as a market maker matching buyers and sellers , enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation ' s energy and gas markets . enron ' s credit - worthiness is hugely important . the better its credit rating , the cheaper it can hedge , or offset , its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers . without that credit rating , the cost of this high - margin , high - volume business starts to rise . a derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to , or derived from , that of an underlying security or asset , such as a stock , bond or commodity . "" even if the company does retain its investment - grade rating , the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses , "" said mr . reynolds at credit sights inc . "" any prudent risk [ manager ] at enron ' s counterparties "" - - any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with enron - - "" is going to be examining their exposure to enron , and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it , "" mr . reynolds said . to be sure , enron , despite its recent woes , remains a strong company , credit analysts said . "" i don ' t think anyone ' s seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default , "" mr . reynolds said . "" so far , our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them , "" said ron barone , managing director of standard & poor ' s utility energy project finance group . "" no one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified . and customers have publicly stated that it ' s business as usual . "" yet analysts say the arrival of distressed - debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for enron and its management . traders expect enron ' s new chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon and chairman kenneth lay to make the rounds of wall street next week , meeting with rating agencies , debt - trading desks , big bond holders and banks , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . treasurys treasurys rallied on optimism that the federal reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the sept . 11 terrorist attacks . prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week ' s flood of treasury , corporate and agency debt issues . at 4 p . m . edt , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 13 / 32 point , or $ 4 . 0625 per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 103 20 / 32 . its yield fell to 4 . 537 % from 4 . 588 % wednesday , as yields move inversely to prices . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price was up 22 / 32 point at 101 11 / 32 to yield 5 . 284 % , down from 5 . 330 % wednesday . fed policy makers are slated to meet on nov . 6 . also providing support for longer maturities , the treasury department made another repurchase of issues outstanding . it received offers for $ 5 . 04 billion in callable 30 - year bonds , of which it accepted $ 1 billion . the offer - to - cover ratio , an indication of demand , was 5 . 04 . treasury buyback par par high wtd avg coupon mat amt amt accept accept % date offer accept price price 7 . 125 02 / 23 807 0 n / a n / a 11 . 750 02 / 10 235 0 n / a n / a 10 . 000 05 / 10 490 0 n / a n / a 12 . 750 11 / 10 471 0 n / a n / a 13 . 875 05 / 11 104 0 n / a n / a 14 . 000 11 / 11 203 0 n / a n / a 10 . 375 11 / 12 587 0 n / a n / a 12 . 000 08 / 13 974 0 n / a n / a 13 . 250 05 / 14 473 0 n / a n / a 12 . 500 08 / 14 725 39 3152 . 20 152 . 19 11 . 750 11 / 14 7826 0 7148 . 25 148 . 13 amounts in millions , prices in decimals . * amount outstanding after operation . calculated using amounts reported on announcement . corporate bonds motorola inc .

"" so is this a stock to avoid , in his view ? hardly . goldman on wednesday did bump enron off its "" u . s . select list , "" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks - - but mr . fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm ' s larger but prestigious "" recommended list "" of 200 or so favored stocks , where it has been since he joined goldman in 1993 . "" just because i can ' t be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn ' t mean that you write off that industry and say ` i can ' t analyze it ' or ` i can ' t figure it out , ' "" says mr . fleischer , who owns an undisclosed number of enron shares . "" if that were the case , there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn ' t follow . "" enron ' s shares have dropped about 50 % since last week . "" every sell - side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box , "" says jim chanos , principal of kynikos associates in new york , who has been selling enron stock short - - trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall - - throughout this year . "" it was really a trust - me story , when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust . "" true , no stock picker is immune from bad calls . and wall street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias , particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment - banking deals to be had . but enron stands apart , precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company ' s disclosure practices are lacking . which raises the question : how can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company ' s operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable ? concerns about the way that enron runs its business aren ' t new . many of the issues now plaguing enron ' s stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge - fund managers and independent accounting experts . yet time and again , wall street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company ' s various partnership transactions . besides those partnerships , enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings . through it all , most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock - market darling , publicly dismissing questions about the firm ' s accounting practices and level of disclosure . as of yesterday , of the 17 analysts who following the stock , 10 had a "" strong buy "" or equivalent rating on the stock , according to thomson financial / first call . five others rated the stock a "" buy , "" though not strongly . only prudential securities , which downgraded the stock this week , has a "" sell "" rating on enron . the bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high - profile examples of wall street taking a glass half - full stance , despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less - enthusiastic approach was warranted . over the past year in the wake of the nasdaq composite index ' s general collapse , analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence - - particularly those who , like goldman ' s mr . fleischer , own shares in the companies they cover . regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment - banking fees and other revenue . enron has spread the wealth across many wall street firms . for instance , for one $ 865 million equity offering in 1999 led by ` credit suisse first boston , enron retained seven co - managers , including donaldson lufkin & jenrette , lehman brothers and merrill lynch . "" enron is a big company , and i don ' t think you ' re going to find a firm that hasn ' t been involved , "" says credit suisse first boston analyst curt launer , who still rates the stock a "" strong buy "" with a $ 40 price target . "" they pay a lot of investment - banking fees to wall street .

"" in july , fastow exited a limited partnership , from which he had reportedly reaped large profits , after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement . concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence . but that won ' t be an easy task , given the resentment about enron ' s disinclination to explain its problems . one analyst called fastow ' s departure "" unsettling , "" noting that management had given the cfo its endorsement only the day before . sounding a note of exasperation , analysts at j . p . morgan chase , banc of america securities and prudential all downgraded the stock . and there could be more trouble to come : the securities and exchange commission has issued enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions . 4 . gold diggers it ' s understandable that investors felt panicky in september . unfortunately , some reacted by shoving their hard - earned money into gold funds . according to financial research corp . , which tracks fund flows , the specialty precious - metals category was the best - selling equity category during september , with net inflows of $ 101 million . granted , that ' s not a huge sum in the mutual fund world . by comparison , during the same month , large growth funds saw net redemptions of $ 7 . 4 billion . but the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy , given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long . sure , under the bizarre circumstances of late , they ' ve enjoyed somewhat of a pop . according to morningstar , the average precious - metals fund is up 10 . 08 % year to date . but over the past five years , the same category lost an embarrassing 14 . 68 % . by comparison , even large - cap growth funds - - everybody ' s favorite whipping boy - - managed to post a positive return . in the same period , they were up 7 . 13 % . moreover , circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades - - a combination of attacks on the u . s . government and war - - still don ' t seem to have boosted gold prices significantly . despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks , they ' re again approaching their pre - sept . 11 levels . it ' s too early to say , but it ' s likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again . 5 . amazon amazes once again amazon ( amzn : nasdaq - news - commentary ) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter . well , at least it will post a pro forma operating profit . ok , so maybe that wouldn ' t include amazon ' s service on $ 2 . 17 billion in long - term debt or extraordinary charges . in fact , a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy , meaningless aura of minor triumph . the company still hasn ' t said when it will turn an economic profit . for that matter , even the fourth - quarter prediction is iffy . after announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit , cfo warren jenson added the humble qualifier , "" there are no guarantees . "" amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth - quarter revenue , predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10 % compared with a year ago . third - quarter trends weren ' t encouraging . though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago , revenue from the company ' s core books and music business actually fell 12 % . at least the company has made progress in cutting costs : a spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20 % over the past year . incidentally , in the wake of amazon ' s earnings report , two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock , which has fallen 93 % from its high back in december 1999 . merrill lynch analyst henry blodget and sg cowen analyst scott reamer downgraded the stock to "" neutral "" from previous buy ratings .

"" even though ( enron ) shot themselves in the foot , the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear , "" ellinghaus said . ubs warburg analyst ronald barone echoed that sentiment . "" the collateral damage to the rest of the space - dynegy and el paso - is overdone , "" barone said . on thursday , williams companies inc . of tulsa , okla . , reported net income of $ 760 million and reliant resources inc . of houston reported $ 133 million in profits . "" it ' s business as usual , "" said dynegy spokesman steve stengel . not for enron , whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india and the surprise departure in august of then - chief executive jeff skilling was considered another bad sign . on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of $ 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of $ 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings . excluding the charge , enron earned $ 393 million on $ 47 . 6 billion in revenues for the three months ending sept . 30 . ellinghaus said the stocks of enron ' s competitors were brought down wednesday because of "" dire "" speculation that enron ' s troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as duke and dynegy . "" all i ' m hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality , "" ellinghaus said . enron did not return calls seeking comment thursday . donnell of duke energy said the charlotte , n . c . - based company is paying close attention to the enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid .

0,"you need to learn how declarations work in C. You have specified testbuff as ""an array of 1024 pointers to characters"". That means, you have allocated an array big enough to store 1024 pointers. On most machines, that's 4 bytes per pointer, which indeed would give you 4096.JohnOn Fri, Nov 22, 2002 at 10:27:53PM +0500, Ali Saifullah Khan wrote: > Here is a test done on the return of sizes by sizeof() using pointers. > > #include > > int main(void) { > char *testbuff[1024]; > > int len = sizeof(testbuff); > cout << len << ""\n""; > return 0; > } > > c:>debug\testbuff > 4096 > > The output from this is 4096 but infact it should be returning 1024. > Apparently, using a pointer has multiplied the value of the original size of > the testbuff[] buffer by the size of the "" pointer "" ? > > char pointers have a size of 4 bytes.....as is shown when output is 4 bytes > using "" int len = sizeof((char*)testbuff); "" > > c:>debug\testbuff > 4 > > so sizeof is returning the size of the ""first"" entity passed to it, that > being the size of the pointer.

my own email address. After reviewing the message I forwarded it with

u = 5526 & m = 1402 , alternative url : warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the focus in the gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growing sense that supplies might just prove adequate . the result has been a steady and steep decline in the november nymex price from $ 5 . 63 per mmbtu on october 12 into the $ 4 . 60 s as of october 25 . cash prices have followed suit , falling from the mid - $ 5 . 50 s to the $ 4 . 60 s at the henry hub , and gas is now pricing below residual fuel oil in the gulf coast and especially on the east coast . although gas storage inventories will begin the winter at levels higher than expected , in cera  , s view adequate supply for the winter is not yet assured , and the market remains subject to a quick return to prices well above $ 5 . 00 with the first cold snap . storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) for the week ended october 20 accompanied by broad - based and continuing warm weather have driven the shift in market psychology . last week  , s injection rate was 26 . 5 bcf , or approximately 3 . 8 bcf per day , above the previous five - year average for those seven days and 58 bcf above the 13 bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending october 22 . with warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures expected next week , cera now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 , 784 bcf on october 31 - - still an all - time low entering the winter , by 26 bcf ( see table 1 ) . is this inventory level "" enough "" ? not yet . storage inventories this winter under 15 - year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 bcf , 22 bcf above the previous all - time low . this end - of - march minimum implies total withdrawals in the united states this winter of 2 . 0 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , 128 bcf above last year  , s withdrawals . but holding withdrawals this winter down to 2 . 0 tcf in the face of a return to normal weather - - and the demand rebound of 3 . 0 bcf per day it would bring - - will be difficult . although the beginning of a us supply rebound and growing imports will add approximately 1 . 0 bcf per day to supplies this winter , holding withdrawals down requires both of the following : * industrial markets - - mainly ammonia and methanol producers - - that are now shut down because of high gas prices must remain shut down . these markets represent approximately 0 . 5 bcf per day of demand that could return , should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol . * the nearly 1 . 5 bcf per day of switchable load now burning residual fuel oil must remain off of gas . in cera  , s view , for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis , particularly as power loads increase this winter , it must become apparent that winter demand can be met , the current resid load can return to gas , and storage inventories can be held reasonably near the previous record low . that low , 758 bcf , occurred in march 1996 and was accompanied by a february average price of $ 4 . 41 and a march average of $ 3 . 00 at the henry hub . that spring , however , us productive capability was nearly 4 . 0 bcf per day greater than it is today , winter power generation demand was lower , and there were about 4 . 5 million fewer residential and commercial gas customers in the united states . market fundamentals in cera  , s view still support gas prices above those of resid , which as of this writing is pricing in the $ 4 . 75 - $ 5 . 00 per mmbtu range . warm weather throughout november and into december could reverse this relationship , but a warm october alone is insufficient , and any cold weather within the next few weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the market . cera  , s price outlook for november - - an average of $ 5 . 50 at the henry hub - - stands for now . * * end * * follow url for pdf version of this alert with associated table . cera ' s autumn 2000 roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at http : / / www . cera . com / event account changes to edit your personal account information , including your e - mail address , etc . go to : http : / / eprofile . cera . com / cfm / edit / account . cfm this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"" enron ' s employees have gotten the short end of the stick in the sudden collapse of this company , "" said labor secretary elaine l . chao . enron has said that a temporary freeze that kept some employees from shifting retirement investments was long planned and allowed another company to take over the job of administering the plan . enron declined to say how much was paid out in bonuses , who received the money or what the range of payments was . executives of companies entering bankruptcy defend such payments as necessary if there is to be any hope of reorganizing as a going concern . but they often prove to be incendiary . for example , in 1990 , when it was disclosed that drexel burnham lambert had paid key executives some $ 250 million in bonuses before filing for bankruptcy , creditors and the government reacted with outrage . in the end , after court hearings on the issue , the drexel estate sued the employees to get the money back . the payments by enron "" are substantially high , and that means it probably does become an issue in the bankruptcy case , "" said james feder , a bankruptcy lawyer with feder & mills , a law firm in los angeles . "" the question might come up as to whether there was fair consideration given for the amount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonable under the circumstances . "" if creditors can convince the court that the employees were overpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money out of creditors ' hands , a much more difficult argument to prove - then the judge can void the payments and order the money returned , said lynn lopucki , a law professor at the university of california at los angeles . to tamp down such disputes , a company typically will file a request , as part of its bankruptcy filing , to make payments to certain employees , and not proceed with the payments until receiving a judge ' s approval , mr . lopucki said . yesterday , mark palmer , an enron spokesman , defended the payments as necessary "" in order to protect and maintain the value of the estate . "" such payments "" are done in every bankruptcy , "" he said , adding that the payments were made to employees "" at all levels of the organization . "" employees who lost their jobs after enron filed for bankruptcy protection on sunday were told they may receive no more than $ 4 , 500 in severance pay . they also were told to petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacation days . in another legal slap at enron , a shareholder lawsuit filed late tuesday accused 29 enron officers and directors of engaging in "" massive insider trading "" and making "" false and misleading "" statements about the company ' s financial performance while selling about $ 1 . 1 billion worth of stock over the last three years . an enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit , which was filed by amalgamated bank , which is known to be an activist shareholder . how to advertise - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web , please contact alyson racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo for general information about nytimes . com , write to help @ nytimes . com . copyright 2001 the new york times company"

traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty

0,"I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of
Spamassassin as an SMTP relay.
It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the
early stages of testing.On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)
Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the
mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address
(spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a
local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom
recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)
Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam""
Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private
smtp address back on the Exchange server.So the message flow is like this:Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for
spammedalot@yourdomain.comspammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to
killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.comFollowing the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to
nomorespam@yourdomain.com
Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second
one I protected was postmaster.As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one
dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address
you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done
load-testing, this is the way it will stay.-jake

Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush ViewsBy Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

Jobs touts OS X, iPods, iMacNEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.July 17, 2002, 8:30 AM PT
 | Read Full Story Scient files for Chapter 11 Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.
The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

 | Read Full Story Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouthWhat does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.July 17, 2002, 3:00 AM PT
 | Read Full Story New chip may portend ATI comebackATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

0,"I'm sure that The Beatles are weel happy with Microserfs for robbing them
blind of their ""intellectual Property""I'm gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these
windows cd's ;--)Don't suppose you have a reference for it? I've made a lot of friends in the
MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away
with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality
though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded
or some buzz like that. ---------------------
I've got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers,	John Gay

"" the enron spokesman said yesterday that the company ' s trading partners are doing business with enron on "" essentially the same terms "" as they have in the past . "" there has been no significant change in the credit conditions , "" he said . trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant ' s finances . the banks involved in the current negotiations , including j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . , are asking enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past , one official said . bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that enron can meet its commitments .

' ' the board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate , ' ' an enron spokesman said . two weeks ago , enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who was ousted last week . the company also disclosed about $ 1 billion in separate write - offs , and it said last week that the securities and exchange commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting . enron hopes to maintain its investment - grade credit rating , which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it . lately , enron ' s bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds , and two major credit - rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company ' s rating . copyright ? 2000 dow jones oct 29 , 2001 by agencies : agency material and elizabeth wine enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week , doing severe damage to mutual funds , the company ' s largest institutional ownership bloc , and the havoc may continue . more than 15 per cent of the 4 , 000 us equity funds held shares in the embattled company ' s shares as of the most recent reporting period , according to fund tracker morningstar . mutual funds held a fifth of enron ' s shares , but that percentage is likely to be much lower now , say fund analysts , who suggest much of the stock ' s halving in october is due to large sales by institutional holders . janus , the growth fund specialist , was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings , dated june 30 , with more than 42 m shares representing a stake worth dollars 2 . 1 bn . the stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth dollars 659 m at friday ' s closing price of dollars 15 . 40 . enron shares dropped 95 cents , or 5 . 81 per cent on friday , taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . on friday , several leading rating agencies put the company ' s debt on credit watches , and enron bond prices plunged . the company ' s stock is down 81 per cent since january . most fund managers , including those at janus , refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading . however , several mutual fund groups with large enron stakes have said their listed positions are "" dated "" , implying that the funds ' positions in the company have changed . morningstar analyst christine benz , who follows the janus funds , said managers of the group ' s larger funds had been "" lightening up "" their enron holdings this year . she said blaine rollins , who manages the dollars 23 bn flagship janus fund , said that in september he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2 . 15 per cent of outstanding shares as of april 30 - but did not say when . ken zschappel , manager of the dollars 11 bn aim constellation fund , also declined to discuss his holdings , listed as 0 . 27 per cent of outstanding shares as of march 31 . but aim said the position had since been "" trimmed substantially "" . other top fund owners , as of the most recent filings , included the alliance premier growth fund , the janus twenty , janus mercury and janus growth & income funds , fidelity magellan , axp new dimensions fund , putnam investors , putnam voyager and putnam new opportunities funds and morgan stanley dividend growth fund . copyright : the financial times limited comment & analysis - enron flickers . by simon london and sheila mcnulty . 10 / 29 / 2001 financial times ( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved comment & analysis - enron flickers - once a paragon of the new economy , the us energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free - wheeling management , write simon london and sheila mcnulty . enron has some explaining to do . for the past decade or more , the texas - based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast - growing energy trader . now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind . its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year . the us securities and exchange commission is investigating multi - million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer , which resulted in a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity . a hastily - convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these "" related - party transactions "" . the departure of andy fastow , the aforementioned cfo , soon followed . with its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies , enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines . yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity . "" this marks the end of enron ' s walk on the wild side , "" observes curt launer , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , the investment bank . on the surface , events at enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions , a complex capital structure and poor investor relations . but the root causes go back further . the entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled enron ' s growth in the 1990 s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis . therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "" new economy "" magic on to old economy companies . enron ' s transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of jeffrey skilling , who was hired from mckinsey , the management consulting firm , to develop energy trading . for the previous decade enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating us energy markets under the guidance of kenneth lay , a former deputy under - secretary of energy . mr lay remains chairman . but it was mr skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it . the two sides of the business - trading and generation / supply - have always been strange bedfellows . the former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on wall street than in a utility . mr skilling ' s answer in the early 1990 s was to bring in talent from outside the company . one of his first recruits was mr fastow , an expert in securitisation , the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets . the energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself . a management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice - president , director , manager and associate / analyst - much like a consulting firm . employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked , so long as they delivered results . as one of mr skilling ' s early recruits recalled : "" it was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules . "" the seemingly free - wheeling style was based on a "" loose - tight "" management model expounded by tom peters and bob waterman , the management writers and mckinsey alumni . at enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets . up - and - coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory . louise kitchen , the 32 - year - old british executive who was the creative force behind enron online , the group ' s internet - based trading platform , changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years . balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk , legal commitments , finance and performance evaluation / remuneration . mr skilling once described the approach in this way : "" as long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens , you can do whatever you want around here . "" this approach did deliver growth and innovation . as well as making markets in its core energy products , enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals . the success of enron online allows the group to describe itself as the world ' s leading e - commerce company . it has also started marketing electricity to us consumers through a joint venture with international business machines and america online , the internet service provider . in february this year mr skilling got his reward : he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in fortune magazine ' s list of the 500 most powerful us corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as ibm , at & t , bank of america and boeing . in retrospect , however , this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price . first was the personal cost to mr skilling . in august he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job . personal , non - health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation . a second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity . in order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded , enron used a range of off - balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion . ljm , the private equity fund in which mr fastow played a role , is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to enron ' s accounts . other financing vehicles include osprey , marlin , whitewing , atlantic water trust and azurix . "" they went after too many things too quickly , "" says stephen moore of moody ' s investors service , the credit ratings agency . a third cost , associated with the last , was a loss of financial transparency . the group ' s extensive use of swaps , options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed . david fleischer , an analyst at goldman sachs , summed up the views of many investors during last week ' s conference call . he told the group ' s management : "" the company ' s credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure . there is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable . "" the fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus . "" the problems , in our view , stem from enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills , "" argues raymond niles , analyst at salomon smith barney . "" power plants in india , water companies , extension of their franchise to the mass retail market , and using a fibre - optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated , or only tangentially related , to their core merchant energy business . "" enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures . this time last year mr skilling was arguing that enron broadband was a business worth $ 35 bn ( # 24 bn ) in its own right . this helped push the share price to all - time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise . "" they over - promised on the new business they created , "" says chris bartlett , a professor at harvard business school and long - time watcher of the company . "" enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with enron online and the broadband business . to some extent they are now paying the price . "" will enron weather the storm ? notwithstanding the risk of further out - of - the - blue financial shocks , most analysts believe that it will . the merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable . mr niles at salomon smith barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30 - 40 per cent annual growth over the past three years . assets totalling more than $ 4 bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted , underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group ' s portfolio of physical energy assets . and yet the doubts remain . it is , ultimately , a question of confidence and credibility . investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former . mr lay and his team will have to tighten up .

"" one is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them . and two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth , "" patterson said . as earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward , some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment . and plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off . shares of enron slid $ 1 . 05 , or 6 . 4 percent , to $ 15 . 30 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange on friday . the world has changed aes corp . , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in brazil and britain , said thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets . "" it ' s a different place , "" aes ' chief executive officer dennis bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year ' s powerful growth . on friday , constellation energy group , parent company of baltimore gas & electric , scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes . constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with goldman sachs , which planned to make an equity investment in the company . "" the utility industry and energy markets , and indeed the entire u . s . economy , have changed considerably in the past year . as a combined company , we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver , "" said christian poindexter , constellation ' s chairman . return to traditional values bakke said one prong of aes ' s brave , new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable , long - term contract generation business . it makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long - term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth , according to gordon howald , energy analyst with credit lyonnaise . "" calpine does it already , "" he said , referring to the california - based independent power producer that has the lion ' s share of the power it generates contracted out . "" what drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient . physical reserve margins were low . but with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level , "" he added . howald said with all the new generation coming on , natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further , squeezing spark spreads , or profit margins , for solely gas fired companies . smaller companies also rethink strategies as lower power prices impact earnings , many power companies are turning back to u . s . markets to try to maximize their bottom line . "" earnings for the quarter is not the big deal . the big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected . it ' s a downward revision of earnings guidance . "" said patterson . michigan - based cms energy corp . cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $ 2 to $ 2 . 05 for 2002 , down from $ 2 . 79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in north america . cms , whose earnings were down for the third quarter , said it took a charge for planned divestitures , south american energy distribution units as well as other international investments . allegheny energy inc . also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings . the maryland - based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets , it will not proceed with the offering at this time .

' ' but less than a year later , everybody seems to have lost , especially enron ' s investors . enron ' s stock is plunging , and questions about its finances are mounting . some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens , trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile . in a worst - case outlook , enron could become the 2001 version of long - term capital management , the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998 . enron ' s shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year , erasing $ 50 billion in shareholder value . enron closed on friday at $ 15 . 40 , down 95 cents , after hitting a 52 - week low of $ 15 . 04 earlier in the day . the future of electricity deregulation is in doubt , thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in california earlier this year - - a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation ' s basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market . enron ' s efforts to become a profit - making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures . in august , mr . skilling quit , forcing kenneth l . lay , his predecessor as chief executive and still enron ' s chairman , to resume day - to - day control of the company . the company declined to make senior executives , including mr . lay , available for comment , and asked that questions be submitted in writing . mr . skilling could not be reached . enron ' s problems boiled over earlier this month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in enron ' s regular financial statements . the securities and exchange commission is looking into the company ' s financial reporting , and some investors question whether enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas . the slump in the company ' s shares accelerated after enron revealed the fall in its shareholders ' equity . on wednesday , the company forced out its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , who is at the center of the controversy over enron ' s confusing finances . the company , which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from california ' s energy crisis , today faces a potential cash crunch . the surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors ' smoldering concern about enron ' s opaque financial statements . now , with wall street analysts and bond - rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company ' s profits , enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash . enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash . on thursday , the company drew down a $ 3 . 3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , which have each extended at least $ 400 million . but because of enron ' s importance in the natural gas and electricity markets , industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide . the supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed , because enron is mainly a trader , rather than a producer , of energy . but a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices , which have swung wildly in the last year . philip k . verleger jr . , an energy - markets economist , emphasized that he thought enron would survive this crisis . but he said it was not clear what would happen if enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company ' s enrononline internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations . ' ' you suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there - - are they good ? are the firm ' s hedges good ? what ' s the situation ? ' ' mr . verleger said . ' ' it ' s got everyone scared . ' ' in the short run , enron ' s credit rating may be its biggest problem . if the company ' s rating falls below investment grade , enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed . but creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable , because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company . a drop in the company ' s credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with enron , hurting the company ' s sales and profits . enron ' s credit rating stands several notches above the critical point . but its bonds , which are publicly traded , have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent , comparable with many junk bonds . two of the three major credit - rating agencies , moody ' s investors service and fitch investors service , have put enron ' s bonds on review for possible downgrades . ' ' the issue that ' s in the front of everybody ' s mind right now is credit , ' ' said mark gurley , senior vice president and general manager for trading at aquila inc . , one of the nation ' s largest energy traders . aquila is based in kansas city , mo . for now , aquila and other major energy traders and producers , including reliant energy , the el paso corporation and dynegy , are continuing to do business with enron . and mr . gurley said that enron ' s own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of long - term capital management in 1998 . ' ' they haven ' t done anything trading - wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down , ' ' he said . still , some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with enron , especially long - term contracts . they also said risk - management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation . mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said on friday that no energy - trading company had stopped doing business with enron . he declined to say whether any of the company ' s trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms . he said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business . but the crisis that enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront . for years , the details of enron ' s finances have been a mystery even to the wall street analysts whose job it is to follow the company , and to the investors who own its stock and bonds . when enron ' s profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets , shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements . now they do . yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask . to others in the industry , the opaqueness of the company ' s financial statements parallels enron ' s efforts to keep its energy - trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements . though they do not expect enron to crumble like long - term capital management , they say that , like the giant hedge fund , enron uses a lot of debt , regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances . the most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet . with names like marlin and osprey , the partnerships have at least $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds outstanding , backed by assets like a stake in azurix , enron ' s water company subsidiary . enron has promised that if the partnerships ' debts exceed the value of their assets , enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference . deals with partnerships formed by mr . fastow , who was chief financial officer when they were organized , led to the $ 1 . 2 billion write - off in shareholders ' equity that enron announced last week . the company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships . enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter , after being criticized by shareholders . in the process , it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books , reducing its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . but , because of complex accounting rules , the transaction was not apparent in enron ' s quarterly earnings report . the transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that enron may have found a way to hide losses , throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question . when enron released third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 , it reported a loss from $ 1 billion in write - offs on failed investments . the earnings statement did not mention the additional $ 1 . 2 billion equity write - down . but the company said its core business had been solidly profitable , and its shares rose . in a conference call with analysts after the announcement , mr . lay , enron ' s chairman , also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity . the reference was a brief one , however , and some listeners did not catch it . those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what enron had done , and many were confused by the accounting procedure . enron ' s stock began to slide , and investors clamored for more information about the write - off . but so far , the company ' s efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors . mr . lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals , but some on wall street say they have come away with doubts about mr . lay ' s grasp of the situation . they say that the two people at enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals - - mr . skilling and mr . fastow - - have both left the company . in an interview in late august , mr . lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving mr . fastow . in response to one question about them , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' ' mr . palmer of enron disputed any suggestion that mr . lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue , saying mr . lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the s . e . c . investigation . ' ' there is not a whole lot we can say , or should say , about them , ' ' mr . palmer said . he also said the company expected to generate about $ 3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year . in a conference call on tuesday , analysts pressed mr . lay and other top enron executives to reveal more information about the ljm write - down and its other partnerships . instead , they offered only vague explanations of the deal , leaving wall street worried that more write - offs might be coming . david fleischer , a goldman , sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company , was among those who came away concerned . ' ' if enron is unable to clarify its off - balance - sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position , then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets , ' ' he wrote in a research note after the call . to try to reassure investors , enron said late thursday that enrononline , its internet - based trading exchange , executed more than 8 , 400 trades that day , a higher - than - normal volume . ' ' we know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community - - and we ' re working on that , ' ' mr . lay said in a statement . ' ' but in the meantime , the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to enron . ' ' but those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for wall street . enron ' s stock tumbled almost 6 percent friday , to its lowest levels in six years . now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of enron ' s off - balance - sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees . carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities in houston , calculates that enron may have close to $ 9 billion in off - balance - sheet debt . she said that enron had for two years been trying to sell about $ 6 billion in foreign assets - - including properties in latin america and a power plant in india embroiled in a dispute with the state government - - and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of enron ' s problems and the souring economy . ' ' as enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs , they may have to write those assets down , ' ' ms . coale said . on wednesday , she downgraded her rating on enron to ' ' sell ' ' from ' ' neutral . ' ' ' ' the bottom line is , it ' s really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts , ' ' ms . coale said . short - sellers , who attacked enron ' s accounting even before the company disclosed the write - off , say the company ' s problems may run even deeper than analysts fear . enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money - losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business , they say . ' ' the company still isn ' t disclosing enough to know whether the core business , the trading business , is profitable , ' ' said mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , which recommended shorting enron ' s stock on may 7 , when it stood at $ 59 . 43 . ' ' the issue remains : why are they doing these transactions ? our theory has been that the core operations aren ' t that profitable . ' ' james chanos , a leading short - seller who has bet that enron ' s stock will fall , said , ' ' is enron booking gains when it has real profits , but hiding the losses when deals go against it ? ' ' mr . palmer of enron said the company stood by its reported energy - trading profits . even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of enron ' s positions . enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset , in roughly equivalent amounts , by energy it has agreed to buy . ' ' with these guys , they tell us - - and all you ' ve got is their word - - that they ' re hedged , ' ' said mr . verleger , the economist . in fact , enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations . last year , the company successfully lobbied congress to effectively ensure that its internet - trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the commodity futures trading commission . enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the federal energy regulatory commission , the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets . but the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices . large - scale energy trading has existed for only about a half - dozen years . enron pioneered the business , and now dominates it , accounting for about one - quarter of all trading in the united states . before congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity , a process that began in earnest a decade ago , the power business was a simpler affair . utilities were given areas of monopoly service , and their rates - - and ability to deliver enough electricity - - were overseen by state regulators . but with the move to deregulate the business , independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished , providing an ever - growing portion of the nation ' s power . beginning in the 1980 ' s , the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated , spurring enron , which used to be primarily a gas - pipeline company , to move into the trading business . the company ' s shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid - 1990 ' s , with the ascension of mr . skilling , who became chief executive in february , just six months before his unexpected resignation . underscoring the change in direction , in securities filings this year enron described its principal business as ' ' security brokers , dealers and flotation . ' ' before , it had said it was in the business of ' ' wholesale - petroleum and petroleum products . ' ' for most of its ascent , enron reported outstanding profit figures and wall street accepted them with pleasure . a year ago , when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by mr . fastow , the company ' s former chief financial officer , analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of mr . fastow ' s involvement . enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch . but the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short - term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring . the controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year - - unless enron loses its investment - grade credit rating before that . enron will also need to maintain its large trading positions , which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about enron ' s credit . when long - term capital was stumbling in 1998 , some wall street rivals sold the securities they thought long - term owned , trying to force long - term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss . something similar in energy markets might be possible . if so , enron might find , as long - term did , that positions that should offset each other do not . enron ' s new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company ' s profits are real , and that its condition is better than the short - sellers believe . as questions are answered , confidence , and the share price , could rebound . but for now , investors are skittish , and some competitors are eager to take advantage of enron ' s plight . photos : enron , which is building a new headquarters in houston , grew with deregulation . but with deregulation in doubt , enron stock has dropped .

' ' enron treated that like a share buyback , even though the shares in question had not been issued , and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings . q . is that legal under the accounting rules ? a . presumably it is . but enron ' s limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure . enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements , while leaving profits on them . that may become clearer when the securities and exchange commission , which has begun preliminary inquiries , completes its work . floyd norris copyright ? 2000 dow jones section 3 databank investors seem to ignore discouraging news by michael brick 10 / 28 / 2001 the new york times page 17 , column 3 c . 2001 new york times company investors sent stocks markedly higher last week , despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor . the dow jones industrial average , strengthened by triple - digit rallies on monday and thursday , ended the week nearly back to its level of sept . 10 , one day before the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on sept . 10 . investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected . they also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago , at some companies by more than 30 percent . all the bad news , investors seemed to surmise , meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy , with tax breaks , spending and lower interest rates . the dow average gained 341 . 06 , or 3 . 7 percent , to close at 9 , 545 . 17 . the nasdaq composite index rose 97 . 65 points , or 5 . 8 percent , to 1 , 768 . 96 . the standard & poor ' s 500 - stock index rose 31 . 13 , or 2 . 9 percent , to 1 , 104 . 61 . michael brick charts : ' ' stocks in the news ' ' enron nyse : ene the energy trading company ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron caught the attention of the s . e . c . friday ' s close : $ 15 . 40 week ' s change : - 40 . 88 % est .

' s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees . to see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security , you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation - - and one that explains the recent trials of poor tom ridge . mr . ridge is by all accounts a capable leader - - a successful governor of a large state ( pennsylvania ) who won the bronze star for heroism in vietnam . a close friend of george w . bush , he should have been in the administration from the get - go , and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs , including the vice presidency . but after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights , he got zilch . instead of mr . ridge , the administration signed on the pro - life john ashcroft and tommy thompson - - who have brought us where we are today . the farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations - - though mr . thompson often comes across as a chamber of commerce glad - hander who doesn ' t know his pants are on fire , and mr . ashcroft often shakes as if he ' s not just seen great caesar ' s ghost but perhaps john mitchell ' s as well . both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration . they ' ve seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their no . 1 concern . pre - sept . 11 , mr . thompson , in defiance of science , heartily lent his credibility to the bush administration ' s stem cell ' ' compromise ' ' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers . post - sept . 11 , he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat , also in defiance of science . now he maintains that the $ 1 . 5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system - - almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals , not shoring up local hospitals - - is adequate for fighting bioterrorism . this , too , is in defiance of all expert estimates , including that of the one physician in the senate , the republican bill frist . it should also be on mr . thompson ' s conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government ' s house physician - - david satcher , the surgeon general and a much - needed honest broker of public health - - locked away , presumably because dr . satcher , a clinton appointee , became persona non grata in the bush administration for issuing a june report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right . only after mr . ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag . as for mr . ashcroft , he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons . planned parenthood , which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them , has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one . this was true not only before sept . 11 but , says ann glazier , planned parenthood ' s director of security , remains true - - even though her organization , long targeted by such home - grown talibans as the army of god , has a decade ' s worth of leads on ' ' the convergence of international and domestic terrorism . ' ' ms . glazier found the sight of mr . ashcroft and other federal keystone kops offering a $ 1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy . ' ' religious extremists don ' t respond to money , ' ' she points out . such is the state of the f . b . i . , she adds , that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ' ' because we have so many here we ' re afraid we ' re going to lose it ' ' ( perhaps among the timothy mcveigh documents ) . if either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that , say , mayor giuliani does , there wouldn ' t have been a need to draft mr . ridge . even so , he ' s mainly a p . r . gimmick - - a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights . as director of homeland security , he ' s allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies - - so far with roughly a dozen staff members . when asked to define mr . ridge ' s responsibilities , ari fleischer said on wednesday that it was ' ' a very busy coordination job , ' ' but so far mr . ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion . the one specific duty that he has claimed - - in an interview with tom brokaw - - was that he ' d be the one ' ' making the phone call ' ' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers . that presumably comes as news to donald rumsfeld , who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the air force chain of command he publicly codified days after mr . ridge ' s appointment . since the administration tightly metes out the news from afghanistan , we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here - - even as mr . rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the taliban , once expected to implode in days , are proving viet - cong - like in their intractability . the wall street journal also reported this week that ' ' instead of a thankful afghan population , popular support for the taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the u . s . growing .

"" it is one of the items on the agenda , "" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying . the paper said once dabhol serves the final notice , the matter proceeds to arbitration , which would not help india . "" the widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation dpc will win hands down , "" the paper added . a dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately . the source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far . the indian government has not responded to enron ' s offer to buy its equity , but two indian companies , bses ltd and tata power ltd , have shown interest . they have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced , and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount . local business daily , the economic times reported on friday that tata power and bses are willing to pay the founders $ 450 - $ 600 million for the 85 percent stake held by enron , ge and bechtel . enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $ 1 billion , the paper added . officials of tata power and bses were not immediately available for comment .

	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this

0,"ijcai95 workshop on context in nlp call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is "" context of the previous utterance / sentence "" "" context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far "" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in "" official "" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : - sort out as many as possible things before the workshop - help focusing the workshop discussion on the hardest and most controversial issues - raise objections and bring up controversial claims early on in order to prepare well thought of answers and constructive critique participants : a limited number , 30 or so , active participants will be selected on the basis of submitted papers . a small number , 5 or so , of no-paper - attendance-only participants will also be considered ; such persons should submit a one page research summary and a list of relevant publications . attendees are required to register for the main ijcai-95 conference . schedule / deadlines : very soon mosaic home page for the workshop set 3 . 15 . 95 papers received 4 . 03 . 95 selected papers accepted participants chosen 4 . 05 . 95 acceptance notifications sent to authors sent to ijcai selected papers to be included in the working notes list of confirmed participants request for equipment / room 4 . 15 . 95 mosaic home page for the workshop updated e-mail discussion begins 5 . 01 . 95 distributed to the participants final list of specific issues to be discussed at the workshop references to the existing work on context examples and data illustrating various aspects of context 7 . 15 . 95 final list of participants sent to ijcai 8 . 19 . 95 workshop takes place 12 . 01 . 95 written review of the workshop ready paper format : same as ijcai-95 : 12 pt article latex style 15 pages maximum , including title , abstract , figures , and references the first page must include : title author 's name ( s ) affiliation complete mailing address e-mail address phone / fax number ( s ) abstract of 200 or so words keywords submissions : electronic submissions are strongly preferred : direct : anonymous ftp to ftp . cs . wayne . edu ~ pub / context directory place the postscript or ascii version of your paper , your author + title + abstract ascii file , your references ( bibtex format preferred ) file , and a file with sample data and / or specific examples please , name your files with the name of the first author . for example , john block might place there the following : block . ps a . ps version of his paper block . text an ascii version of his paper if . ps not possible block-a . text an ascii file with authors names , title , and abstract block-r . bbl a bibliography file with references block-e . text an ascii file with sample data and / or specific examples email : lucja @ cs . wayne . edu as the last resort , four hard copies of the paper can be snail mailed to lucja iwanska department of computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 , usa ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) info about the workshop and the abstracts of the accepted papers is available via a mosaic home page at http : / / www . cs . wayne . edu / context primary contact : should you have any questions or need additional information , please contact lucja iwanska department of computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 lucja @ cs . wayne . edu ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) program committee : harry c . bunt , kub -

0,"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46455-2002Oct5.htmlA New Theory on Mapping the New WorldBy Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.

0,"re : original karamojong / jie language leo connolly cross-posted a question about karamojong on linguist and sci . lang . i posted a response on sci . lang , and i ' m cross-posting it here . in article ( 1994nov22 . 145346 . 29219 @ msuvx1 . memphis . edu ) , connolly @ cc . memphis . edu writes : ) a colleague of mine would like to know the latest opinion concerning the ) original language of the "" karamojong hordes "" and / or jie , who have abandoned ) their original language in favor of that of the masai . does anyone know ) whether their tongue is best described as "" nilotic "" or "" sudanic "" ? or does n't ) it matter ? and if greenberg classified this language , which se seems to ave ) done , does anyone know if his classification is still generally accepted ( a ) fair question in view of his more recent amerindian debacle ) ? ) bill welmers , in his "" checklist of language and dialect names "" ( sebeok , t . a . , 1971 , current trends in linguistics , vol . 7 : linguistics in sub - saharan africa , the hague : mouton ) lists karamojong as a member of the chari - nile branch of nilo - saharan . in the same volume , greenberg 's article "" nilo - saharan and meroitic "" gives a little more detail , assigning it to the teso group of eastern nilotic , itself a branch of eastern sudanic , which is a branch of chari - nile . its cognate languages within teso are teso , toposa , and turkana . i do n't work on nilo - saharan , so i ' m not up to date on current classification . however , in african languages as a whole , greenberg 's four major families , niger - congo , nilo - saharan , afro - asiatic , and khoi - san have stood up pretty well for the last 30 years . there has been some discussion of a relationship between niger - congo and nilo - saharan , but no convincing case has yet been published . within niger - congo there has been some realignment ( john bendor - samuel , 1991 , the niger - congo languages , university press of america ) , the most significant being the shifting of the benue - congo boundary some 600 or so miles westwards to include what greenberg called eastern kwa . greenberg 's southern cushitic ( afro - asiatic ) is now referred to as omotic and its membership in afro - asiatic seems to be in some doubt . otherwise his african classification works remarkably well . as an africanist who was in graduate school towards the end of the debate on greenberg 's african classification , i see some strong parallels with the amerindian debate . the vehemence , even rancor , of his critics back in the fifties and sixties was no less than what we ' ve seen more recently . it is certainly unfortunate that there is apparently so much flawed data in his american work , something i can't judge but apparently much more than was in his african work , but at the same time his method of mass comparison is more archeological in nature than linguistic and has a remarkably high tolerance for error . i consider the jury still out . flames accepted but probably ignored . herbert stahlke , associate director email : 00hfstahlke @ bsu . edu university computing services phone : 317-285 - 1843 ball state university fax : 317-285 - 1797 muncie , in 47306"

0,"comparative method : n - ary comparison again some time ago , while we were discussing comparative linguistics , the question was raised ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claims in print that binary comparison is preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cited one reference at that time , i thought it might be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which has just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese is altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argues that the odds of finding apparent matches simply by chance when japanese is compared to the four altaic languages / subgroups , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , are four times as high as are the odds of finding such spurious matches when japanese is compared to just one language , specifically korean ( which is singled out by janhunen because there has been a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignored altaic ) . in other words , janhunen assumes that a 5 - ary comparison is four times as likely to produce matches purely by chance ( what i call ' false positives ' ) as is a binary comparison . this , needless to say , is a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la soci t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 ."

1,"re : check this out ! dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , "" please put me on your mailing list "" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won't be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !"

Did you miss out on 
ENVC, UP 280%?, PRCT, UP 300%? HUMT, UP 200% and others? 
NOW What are you waiting for?
Here's another pick - 
Another potential big Play
Â 
      Â  
      PLAY OF THE WEEK OTCBB: 
      NNCO
Â Â Â 
Â 
   MicroCap  MarketingÂ PLAY OF THE WEEKÂ   for ourÂ investors 
      this   week 
      is NANNACO, INC.    (OTCBB: NNCO   ).Â  If you tuned 
      in 
      to our last two picks, you would have noticed that , Â PRCT wentÂ fromÂ a close 
      of $.025 to a high of $0.12.Â  That's a 300% gain in just two days.Â  
      Our other 
  pick, HUMT, almost gained over  200%. PLAY OF THE WEEK tracks stocks on downward trends, foresees 
      bottom and notify our subscribers of it potentialÂ upward movement.Â  We 
      also look for newly trading companies, and stocks that by comparing 
      trading history and shares in the marketplace we believe have great levity 
      upward.

 Â Â  MicroCap 
      Marketing PLAYOF THE WEEK.Â  Our trademark is our 
      uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed-out and anticipate their 
      rebound and upward trend.Â  Most of the stocks we track rebound and 
      peak within just two days, giving investors opportunity to make a few 
      bucks back in such a highly volatile market.Â  We don't believe the 
      market is such as to take any long-term positions right now.Â  But in 
      a highly unstable marketplace, the opportunities for short-term stabs 
      (gains) are abundant.Â  When the question today seems to be which way 
      is up, we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way---it's 
      all a matter of 
timing.

Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy
who goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.

1,"THIS E-MAIL AD IS BEING SENT IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. SENATE BILL 1618, TITLE #3, SECTION 301TO REMOVE YOURSELF SEND A BLANK E-MAIL TO:removal992002@yahoo.comHi,You most likely have seen or heard about 
""The Letter"" $5.00 Paypal Program"" that has been seen lately 
on 20/20 and OPRAH WINFREY...etc... How would you like 
to generate more income through a different avenue? What 
if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another 
program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 
There 
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH 
YOU 
IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest
to you! Please read all of this. This is not something 
that I would normally look at, except that I read an 
article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about 
PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it 
would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had
already experienced their efficiency and good standing. 
You can complete this whole process in one hour and you 
will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! 
Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the 
Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on the
Internet by E-mail.NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from
individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a 
little of their time.TESTIMONIALS FROM:Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:
Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of
our frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 
grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run 
this program again........Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to
you... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said 
and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was 
up to over $12,000! I owe you!GETTING STARTED.If you're not already a user, the very first thing you
need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes 
and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this 
program FREE!Here's the link:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.comBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO 
$100 
DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) 
to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note
like ""Please add me to your mailing list."" BE PREPARED TO GET
EXCITED.... YOU 
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the 
others 
to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No 
printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US 
Postal and 
Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, 
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal 
Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a 
product or service must be exchanged for money received). Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this 
THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much
faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY 
HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see 
results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT 
MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). Ideally, you should
send them to people who send their programs to you or to 
personal contacts who are already working on the web, 
because they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! Besides, this program is 
MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already 
in 
another program, stay with it, but do
yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long 
before others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE 
person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET 
WHEN 
YOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have 
a 
PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 
GIFT 
to
the person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list 
at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow 
the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 
in your bank account!Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT 
POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 
transaction that you get from PayPal!!!Follow These Simple Instructions: E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST 
name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying 
""subscribe me to your mailing list"". Only the first 
person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the 
other 
two names UP and ADD YOUR NAME. Don't try to add your name in the first 
place 
in order to earn money fast! 
If you do that, you will ONLY reach people you send e-
mail to then your name will be immediately removed
from the No.1 place and you can't reach more people! But if 
you add your name on the No.3 place, there will be tons of 
people receiving e-mail's later and when your name is No.1!!! NOTE: Do not forget to replace the PayPal referring URL in 
the body of the letter with your own PayPal referring URL. 
Send out 20 copies (minimum) of this letter.ALSO NOTE: By sending this letter and the payment via E-MAIL, the 
response 
time is much faster... ELECTRONIC TRANSFER INTERNET FAST! Consider this! Millions of people surf the Internet
everyday, all day, all over the world! Here are the 3 people 
to start with. Sign up, send $5.00 to the first person, move 
the other two up to Nos 1 & 2 respectively and add your own 
e-mail address at No.3. Be sure to use your email address that is 
associated 
with your PayPal account.*************************************1.  csreddy3@rediffmail.com2.  tomk4@prodigy.net3.  larryspaypal@yahoo.com *************************************There are fifty thousand new people who get on the
Internet every month! An excellent source ofemail addresses 
is the people who send you offers by email.
The source is UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to
think of all the possibilities! Mail, or should I 
say 'E-mail', your letter and payment TODAY! It's 
so easy. One hour of your time, THAT'S IT!
To send your letter by e-mail, copy this ENTIRE PAGE
and paste it in the message of your E-mail. TO DO THIS:
1. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and ""select all""
2. Go in your toolbar to ""edit"" and select ""copy""
3. Start (compose) a new E-mail message (make sure
it's PLAIN TEXT so everyone can view it!)
4. Fill in your Address and Subject Box
5. Go to ""edit"" and ""paste"" (Then you can format it
anyway you want!)
Now you can edit the addresses with ease. Delete the
top name, adding your name and address to the bottom 
of the list, then simply changing the numbers. Remember, 
YOUR NAME goes on the BOTTOM and the other 2 names move up. But DO NOT 
forget 
to send $5.00 via PayPal (along 
with your note) to the position #1 - TOP E-MAIL
address before deleting it!NOTE: Be sure to replace the PayPal referring URL in
this e-mail of the letter with your own PayPal 
referring URL;
https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO.
When your name reaches the first position in a few
days, it will be your turn to collect your MONEY!
The money will be sent to you by 2,000 to 4,000 people
like yourself, who are willing to invest one hour to 
receive $20,000 in cash! That's all! There will be a 
total of $20,000 in $5.00 bills in your mailbox (account) 
in two weeks. $20,000 for one hour's work! This is 
real money that you can spend on anything you wish!
Just deposit it to your own bank account or spend it 
directly from your PayPal account!!! It's just that 
easy!!! I think it's WORTH IT, don't you?GO AHEAD--- TRY IT!!! EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 OR 4
THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE?IF YOU TRY IT, IT WILL PAY! CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? OF
COURSE YOU CAN---This plan is structured for everyone to send only 20
letters each. However, you are certainly not limited 
to 20. Mail out as many as you want. Every 20 letters 
you send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can 
E-MAIL forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! 
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF IT! Each time you run 
this 
program, just follow steps 1
through 3 and everyone on your gift list benefits! 
Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, there are no 
mailing lists to buy (and wait for), and trips to the 
printer or copier, and you can do it again and again 
with your regular groups or gift givers, or start up 
a new group. Be SURE and PAY the first person on the 
list. This is proof that you paid to get put on the 
list which is the service rendered to make all this 
legal!!! Why not? It's working! Each time you receive 
an MLM offer, respond with this letter! Your name will 
climb to the number one position at dizzying rates. 
Follow the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE 
PLAY FAIR. That's the key to this program's success. 
Your name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on the list 
WILL NOT produce the results you think, and it only cheats 
the other people who have worked hard and have earned the 
right to be there. So please, play by the rules and the 
$$$ will come to you!
$$$ E-MAIL YOUR LETTERS OUT TODAY! Together we will 
prosper! $$$ You are probably skeptical of this, 
especially with all the different programs out there 
on the web, but if you don't try this you will 
never know. That's the way I felt. I'm glad I did it!
I've been watching this type of program for years and
this is about as easy and fast as you can get it and 
it can even be free to try now with Pay Pal, no stamps, 
no envelopes, no copies to be made - just a little effort 
and faith!!! This program really ""Keeps It Short and Simple""! OH BY THE WAY....each time someone signs up with your link 
under your name... you also make $5.00 from PayPal...
so they pay to open up the account but they also pay you when 
someone signs up from being referred by you. AWESOME! 
Let's all make some serious money 
$$$$$$CLICK HERE TO BEGIN:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.comPlay by the rules, this doesn't cost anything but your
time, and if everyone plays fair everyone WINS.
FOLLOWING ARE SOME NOTES ABOUT PayPal WHICH YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL:PayPal 
lets 
you pay anyone with an e-mail address and is the world's No.1 online 
payment 
service - it's accepted on over 3 million eBay T auctions and thousands 
and 
thousands of online shops. You can also use PayPal to 
pay your friends - example; it's a convenient way to 
split the phone bill with your roommate, send cash to your kids in 
college,or 
send cash to someone in another country. Better yet, you can also 
earn $5 while you do it. Each time someone signs up for an account and 
completes the Refer-a-Friend requirements, we'll give you a $5 BONUS! 
When 
you send money through Pay Pal, you can fund your payments with your 
credit 
card or checking account. You won't have to worry about your privacy, 
because 
PayPal keeps your accounting information safe. Making a purchase with 
PayPal 
is more secure than mailing a check or giving your credit card number to 
a 
stranger. That's why over 9 million people from around the world use 
PayPal 
to move money.
Signing up for a PayPal account is easy. It takes only
a couple of minutes and, if you complete the bonus 
requirements PayPal will automatically add $5 to your 
account balance. To learn more about PayPal visit the 
web site athttps://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.com""Best of the Web"" -Forbes
""Using the service is actually safer than a check or
money order""- Wall Street Journal
""PayPal can play a major role in your life. You can
use it to pay for stuff at auction sites, settle 
dinner debts with friends or nudge your cousin to 
repay that $50 he borrowed at the family reunion.- Time
PS. Does this sound too good? Well maybe to some skeptics it
is. But it actually works, and is worth 
the few minutes of your time now. 
P.S.S. If You Decide to Join in on this Venture Please Return a blank 
email 
to the last email address on the list (#3) with ""Thanks, I'll Join"" in
the 
subject line. This Helps everyone keep track of their progress. You Will

The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at
a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship.
You and your family could be lucky winners!

1984! in San Fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate 500 to 3k.This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity in
homosexual men.""I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially young
people, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, ""That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous."" Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, ""Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do."" If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me.""You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume.  BFD.

0,"gene flow and indo - europeans h . m . hubey has made readers of this list aware of an interesting article which appeared in the june 24 , 1995 , issue of science news concerning evidence from dna data indicating a gene flow from anatolia into europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey also points out that there is genetic evidence that nomads from the central eurasian yamna culture spread westward into europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while it is indeed reasonable to link the first migration with the spread of agriculture , it does not follow that those who migrated spoke any form of indo - european ( "" pre - "" , "" proto - "" , or dialects thereof ) . nor does it follow that "" [ i ] t is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of indo - european languages . . . "" we know from cuneiform records that by 3 , 000 bce anatolia was populated ( at least in part , if not in full ) by people speaking caucasian languages . in eastern anatolia , hurrian and the later attested and closely-related urartean were spoken . these languages have been convincingly shown by sergej starostin and igor diakonoff to be related to northeast caucasian . in central anatolia , hattic was spoken - - this was later replaced by hittite , an indo - european language . diakonoff maintains that hattic was also a caucasian language . finally , diakonoff has claimed that the language spoken by the gutians ( qutians ) was a caucasian language . moreover , there are no unambiguous references to indo - european people or languages in written records from the ancient near east until just before 2 , 000 bce , and the first references are to hittites . it is generally agreed by specialists ( for example , gamkrelidze , mellaart , puhvel , steiner , among others ) that the hittites were invaders who imposed themselves upon populations speaking caucasian languages ( in particular , hattic ) . thus , there is much stronger evidence that prior to about 2 , 000 bce , anatolia was populated by speakers of caucasian languages than by speakers of indo - european languages . thus , it follows logically that if one were to attempt to correlate gene flow at about 9 , 000 bp from anatolia to europe with language spread that one would tend to think more about very early forms of caucasian rather than indo - european . allan r . bomhard boston , massachusetts"

That's my understanding of how it works anyway. > > John > > Subject: Re: [ILUG] Optimizing for Pentium Pt.2That was my understanding too, but I since fould out that for Linux:Most programs and libraries by default are compiled with optimizing level 2 (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled for a specific CPU. On Intel platforms software is compiled for i386 processors by default. If you don't wish to run software on other machines other than your own, you might want to change the default compiler options so that they will be compiled with a higher optimization level, and generate code for your specific architecture.Therefore: export CFLAGS=""-O3 -march="" && CXXFLAGS=$CFLAGSThis is a minimal set of optimizations that ensures it works on almost all platforms. The option march will compile the binaries with specific instructions for that CPU you have specified. This means you can't copy this binary to a lower class CPU and execute it.So these are the optimizations I need to worry about, and the optimizations that lfs says to disable before compiling GCC or GlibC. However, GlibC seems the most likely candidate for optimization since it provides the libs used by even the most simple programs to access system calls in the kernel.I'm still waiting for info from the GCC mailing list RE: optimising/patching GCC for performance improvement. So far the only suggestion has been to try using icc, Intels C compiler. It's known to work with the kernel, but user apps, and I guess libs and such might need rewriting to compile, and I'm not prepared to go to this length.For QT and KDE it seems there are also gains to be made with object pre-linking, but there are also risks with this so I'll just have to suck it and see. Either way, I'm going to get started building the base today. I'm still waiting for some DRI patches for my GVX1 card but it'll probably been several days before I'm ready to build X anyway.Cheers, John Gay-- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

0,"summary : negated questions and exclamations about two weeks ago , i posted a query on two subjects : i was looking for languages ( 1 ) which can or , on the contrary , cannot use negated interrogatives like "" look , over there - is n't that john ? "" in order to express a positive expectation , and ( 2 ) which have negated wh-exclamations like german : "" was du nicht alles weisst ! "" ( lit . : ' what you do n't know all ! ' ) or serbocroatian "" sta nije sve doziveo ! "" ( lit . : ' what he did n't all live through ! ' ) , that refer to the positive , not the negative fact . first of all , i wish to thank the following colleagues for their contributions : suzanne albrecht ( sanabria @ zedat . fu-berlin . de ) gisle andersen ( henga @ alf . uib . no ) birgitta englund dimitrova ( birgitta . englund @ tolk . su . se ) frederik fouvry ( fouvry @ llsun4 . essex . ac . uk ) keith goeringer ( keg @ violet . berkeley . edu ) michael israel ( israel @ ling . ucsd . edu ) dalina kallulli ( dalina . kallulli @ avh . unit . no ) jussi karlgren ( jussi @ sics . se ) e . h . klein - v . d . laaken ( klein @ let . rug . nl ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) randy lapolla ( hslapolla @ ccvax . sinica . edu . tw ) pierre larrivee ( aaa552 @ agora . ulaval . ca ) bert peeters ( bert . peeters @ modlang . utas . edu . au ) francisco raga ( raga @ vents . uji . es ) alexandr rosen ( alexandr . rosen @ ff . cuni . cz ) cristina sanz ( sanzc @ gusun . acc . georgetown . edu ) karen stanley ( karen _ stanley @ cpcc . cc . nc . us ) jan vorster ( vorsterj @ mtb . und . ac . za ) ton van der wouden ( vdwouden @ let . rug . nl ) deborah yeager ( kyeager @ prism . nmt . edu ) ning zhang ( zning @ epas . utoronto . ca ) the languages i received information about were : afrikaans , albanian , catalan , chinese , czech , english , dutch , norwegean , spanish , swedish , yucatec maya . no additional languages have been named where the use of negated questions like "" look , over there - is n't that john ? "" was not possible ; so apache and navajo are still the only examples i have found so far . . as to the negated wh-exclamations , what is most interesting is that they do exist in languages where the native speakers i had asked so far had been convinced that they do not . examples for this are english and spanish , cf . : what i did n't do to get that report finished on time ! ( karen stanley ) cuanto no tendre que sufrir hasta conseguirlo ! ( cristina sanz ) this type of construction can obviously be found in much more languages than i had assumed . in some of them , it seems to be old fashened and not very wide spread , but it still exists as such . ( if anybody now comes to think of one more language that allows that type of utterance - i am still collecting , and i ' m grateful for any help i can get ! ) as to the question of why and how these negated questions and wh-exclamations work : i am dealing with it in paper of mine ( to be published ) , and i ' ll be glad to mail it to anybody who is interested , but i ' m afraid it 's in german . thanks once again to all who helped , and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions . elke hentschel"

1,"incredible opportunity dear friend , if you received this message in error , please accept my apologies . i never thought i 'd be the one telling you this : i actually read a piece of e-mail & i ' m going to europe on the proceeds ! hello ! my name is karen liddell ; i ' m a 35 - year-old mom , wife , and part-time accountant . as a rule , i delete all unsolicited "" junk "" e-mail and use my account primarily for business . i received what i assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time . about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , "" ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . "" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . everyday for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you can make at least as much money as we did . you do n't need to be a whiz at the computer , but i ' ll bet you already are . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! go for it now ! ! karen liddell the following is a copy of the e-mail i read : $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legal , money-making phenomenon . print this letter , read the directions , then read it again !

ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended
up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In
particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to
the messages I send to specific lists.For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of
claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is: to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmdawhich rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's
batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about
resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a
TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question
is able to send mail to).				  -+-Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.  Reasons:  nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on
  a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls
  getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).
  Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead
  of SMTP.  Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not
  recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail
  delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use
  sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:    .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv  which creates problems:    Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error    Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error    Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.  ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.      It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout
    about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to
    being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.
    Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a
    non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's
    current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in
    /etc/services) is a pain.I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's
""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:  0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:    DATADIR
    ALLOW_MODE_640
    CRYPT_KEY_FILE
    FINGERPRINT  1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".  2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.  3) Set the following options in exim.conf:    message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""
    message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe  4) /etc/exim/filter reads:    # Exim filter
    testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""
    testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""
    if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and 
       ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and
       ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""
    then
      pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""
      finish
    endif  Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that
  they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for
  your setup.Basic explanation:  Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is
  configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter
  extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru
  that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.  The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement
  for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different
  user, chgrp as appropriate.  It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I
  haven't investigated that end.Notes:  This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA
  has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),
  and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If
  you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for
  other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so
  don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if
  you wish.  A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail
  servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA
  support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less
  complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA
  configuration.Caveat Emptor.    ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a
  ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no
  confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing
  silent sidetracking of mail).--

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have
zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does.""
And Russ Coover continues: ""If you purchase something with a
credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
to dispute the charge.""Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
question (E): ""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500."" And
Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
might not go through because the thief used all of your available
balance.  If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce.
 Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
those fees.  If you have  5 checks outstanding, you could be out
over $100.""Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my
debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally
sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
online purchases.  Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
(during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
debit card and cleaned out your checking account?  The money is
gone! False charges on a credit card are not ""real money"" until
somebody has to pay them.  I would guess that each bank has
different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what
you use or where you choose to use your plastic.

CYG v20020115 [3.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://www.geocities.com/HoloGuides/CyG/{Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects
something. In fact, just the other day I decided to start
collecting dust. It's much easier than collecting stamps. If you
do collect stamps, though, this organizer will help you keep track
of them all. Or you can use it to keep track of your Star Wars
trading card collection, or your coin collection, or your [insert
collection here] collection. It works for everything, get it? It's
also great for managing your MP3 lists, including ID3 tag editing.
""CYG is founded on an object-oriented database approach, and
carefully programmed with one goal in mind: universal usage.""

talk with the power geeks. If you're running on NT, 2000, or XP
and need to know what drivers you have running on your system,
this program can show you. That's not too shabby, but of course,
you can also change or even get rid of certain drivers if you
desire. And that's, um, even more not too shabby. And that Refresh
button is there to make sure you're seeing everything exactly how
you want it. ""DriverManager is a tool designed to allow System

Transloaderhttp://www.transloader.com/""This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server.
Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and
ImageBot.com to send generated images to another server (such as
your Web or FTP server). This is particularly useful for WebTV
users who can't save images on their own machine. Although we have
no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do
through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you
are talking to a slow server, your job may not complete in time.
Other transloaders sometimes suffer from overloading (too many
people using them), which is why I wrote this one. Hopefully, this
will never happen to us, but in any case, check these others out,
they have some nice services...""Recommend It!

Online BrandingTo Share or Not to Share
Scribbled by Lee SmithI think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
attempting to make their CDs ""rip proof"" either. I do not feel
they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played (""why"" is
explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
expense, if at all.If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
(albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.For those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one
day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
to care about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered CDs are
released.Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!

Top 75 Tech SitesWho can save you from making a small oversight with your digital
video camera purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: ""I see that
you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
can you get your old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't.""
This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

0,"basic word order this is a somewhat delayed reaction to frederick newmeyer 's posting on basic word order . i was prepared to let someone else comment on the underlying logic of newmeyer 's message . this did not happen , however , so here comes . newmeyer observes that data from a given language seldom exhibits an unambiguous ' basic word order ' , and there seem to be no generally agreed-upon criteria to resolve this ambiguity . he further notes that this fact reveals a weakness in functionalist linguistics ( or , in more polite terms , ' presents a challenge to it ' ) . he adds , on two occasions , that generative linguistics is increasingly coming to share the same weakness . by ` increasingly ' he must mean the fact that some applications of the principles-and - parameters approach are taking both language-particular and cross-linguistic data into account more seriously than used to be the case . before these developments , generative linguistics decreed that every ( configurational ) language has some sort of basic word order , as specified by the phrase structure ( or x - bar ) component of its grammar . newmeyer seems to suggest that this type of basic word order did not share the weakness that is ' increasingly ' becoming a characteristic of generative linguistics . the difference between earlier generative linguistics and current generative linguistics , and between their respective conceptions of basic word order , resides in the fact that the former did not , whereas the latter does , pay systematic attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data . newmeyer 's formulation then seems to suggest that not paying attention to ( cross - ) linguistic data is a strength of the theory . esa itkonen"

1,"Dear Sir,My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco
Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank
with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,
1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive
as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my
branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom
his name shall be used as the
next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the
banking ethics here does not
allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view
of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing
that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give
you 25% of the total.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail
the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will
not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund
transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply
to the bank as a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying
Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.Respectfully submitted,Obi   W.

We All
Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today's Society.
Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed.
Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:Monday: The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do?
Tuesday:  The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""What now,"" you think to yourself.
Wednesday: You've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?Â 
Thursday: Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven't a clue how to handle
    it.Â 
Friday:  Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?And what about all the other things:Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified?
Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair?
Lost a Security Deposit?
Bought a Home or Purchased A Car?
Signed an Employment Contract?
Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
Had Trouble With Your Credit Report?
Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute?
Been Involved in a separation or divorce?
Had to Collect Child Support?
Prepared A Will or Wanted To?
In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
 but it provides it 24 hours a day, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
 and it is for a small monthly fee. No Kidding.  Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

"" the market is really shrugging off this news , "" said mark donahoe , a managing director at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray . upbeat earnings news from american express , released monday afternoon , seemed to give stocks an additional lift . investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and u . s . military maneuvers in afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results , said steven kroll sr . , managing director at monness , crepsi & hardt . the uncertainty on the global front "" looks like it is going to be a long , drawn - out affair , "" mr . kroll said . "" i think stocks will revert back to being earnings - driven . "" although dismal by ordinary standards , last week ' s flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors , who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations . "" the markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings , "" said mr . donahoe of u . s . bancorp . that resilience might be giving hope to investors this week , he added . still , investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up , mr . kroll argued . third - quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on monday , with big companies such as minnesota mining and manufacturing and u . s . steel posting results that met or topped analysts ' estimates . the dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p . m . edt when index component american express reported earnings that , excluding certain items , beat wall street previously lowered estimates . the financial - services concern posted net income of $ 298 million , or 22 cents a share , down 60 % from $ 737 million , or 54 cents a share , a year earlier . excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the september 11 attacks , american express said it would have earned $ 595 million , or 45 cents a share , for the latest quarter . analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call . shares of american express surged after the quarterly earnings release , closing up 3 . 4 % at $ 30 . 32 . chip stocks helped lead the nasdaq composite higher , with the philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5 . 4 % . the rally seemed to be a continuation of friday ' s gains in the sector , sparked by positive earnings news from kla - tencor . u . s . steel , the nation ' s no . 1 steelmaker , said it swung to a third - quarter loss from a profit a year earlier , hurt by oversupply and a weak economy . but excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another , u . s . steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call . shares of u . s . steel rose 9 . 7 % to $ 14 . 74 . investors also sent 3 m shares nearly 5 % higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by wall street estimates , despite a 21 % decline in net income . and oil producers conoco and usx - marathon group handily beat analysts ' forecasts . but not all the earnings news was cheery . local phone company sbc communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates . shares of sbc , a component of the dow industrials , fell 5 . 1 % to $ 41 . 40 . meanwhile , the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging , some analysts noted . on monday , 3 m guided wall stret ' s earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter , and a top executive at u . s . steel told analysts that the company ' s fourth quarter would be "" difficult . "" companies "" are meeting third quarter expectations , but they are talking down the fourth quarter , "" said mr . kroll of monness crespi & hardt . he said that some of the rise in monday ' s markets might be a carryover from friday ' s buying activity related to the expiration of u . s . stock option and index option contracts , an event known as "" double witching . "" one of the hardest - hit stocks on monday was enron , an energy concern that said that the securities and exchange commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer . shares of enron plunged 21 % to $ 20 . 65 . overseas , stocks closed higher . london ' s financial times - stock exchange 100 - share index gained 1 . 1 % , while frankfurt ' s xetra dax index rose 2 % . earlier in the day , japan ' s nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0 . 3 % , but hong kong ' s hang seng index ended 0 . 3 % lower . in economic news , the conference board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0 . 5 % in september , matching the estimates of economists surveyed by thomson global markets . the index - - a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy - - included some data gathered after the sept . 11 attacks . the decline , which was the index ' s largest one - month drop since january 1996 , confirmed that the widespread weakness in the u . s . economy is deepening , the conference board said . falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the september reading . in august , the leading - indicators index slipped 0 . 1 % , less than the previous estimate of a 0 . 3 % decline . even so , the back - to - back declines paint a bleak economic picture , said conference board economist ken goldstein . the two - month decline in the index suggests that the already - weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year , mr . goldstein said . the overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown . in major u . s . market action : stocks rose . on the big board , where 1 . 09 billion shares were traded , 1 , 813 stocks rose and 1 , 291 fell . on the nasdaq , 1 . 49 billion shares changed hands . bonds were mixed . the 10 - year treasury note rose less than 1 / 16 point monday , or 62 . 5 cents for each $ 1 , 000 invested . the yield , which moves inversely to its price , fell to 4 . 618 % . the 30 - year bond fell 1 / 16 point to yield 5 . 364 % . the dollar rose . the dollar bought 122 . 56 yen , compared with 121 . 20 yen late friday . the euro traded at 89 . 18 u . s . cents , down from 89 . 84 cents late friday . copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ?

MACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody.APPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,
confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
which itself is now not very common.BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang"":  Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
  You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
  You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
  But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-booIt may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.OLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved
back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
date again). See  for
more details and UK ordering information.
2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El NiÃ±o season,
UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
efficient ways of burning fuels.The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.
                                   [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002]A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the
population.

3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Short and fat.Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
as ""picnic"".In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
packed; it appeared first in his book ""KÃ¶rperbau und Charakter""
(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
English.The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
balloons out into obesity.
4. Q&A
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
Rosenthal, California]A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
unwelcome.The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans BreitmannÂ’s
Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this:  The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or
  attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into
  ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress
  was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the
  audience.""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
far higher class"".A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
people derived it from ""Ma ChÃ¨re"", ""the mode of address used by the
gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
but he could hardly know that.Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
accepted:  It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,
  C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word
  ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude,
  or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by
  its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be
  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the
  stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-
  known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of
  it years before the term had become at all popular.Though defunct in British English, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never
quite gone away in America. ""Mash"" had a resurgence of popularity
as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,
though that may be a back-formation from ""mash note"".

""A Spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to Ireland
whether there was a word in his language similar to 'manaÃ±a'. The
Irishman thought for a moment, then said: 'Sure there is, but it
doesn't have the same sense of urgency.'"" [Traditional Irish joke.]

===============================Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians sayWASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
government-issued credit cards?(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
membership.(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.(e) all of the above.""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
billion in goods and services, the audit found.In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
imagine.""Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
 
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
  
""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
 
""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
instead of offending the taxpayer.""

 CNETÂ TECH982.84 Â -24.59Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88 percent, to close at 1,356.95.Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.
AOL used unconventional business practices-Post 
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post reported on Thursday.A chart printed in conjunction with the Post article shows a total of $270.1 million in unconventional deals.AOL TIME WARNER INC 12.45 -5.03% IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits 
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.INTL BUSINESS MACHINES 72.05 1.92% Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2 
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third quarter versus the April-June period.""it will be a reasonable quarter, but it will not represent such a dramatic growth as what might have been seen in some previous years,"" Chief Executive Jorma Ollila told a conference call following the firm's second-quarter result.NOKIA CORP ADS 13.33 -5.59%

J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02 
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a ""market performer"" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTL INC 2.74 14.64%

in the fantasy seems morally outrageous, repugnant or unjustified.
He listed many examples, oldies and goodies.   I don't think the
author meant to come off at the point that you seem to be
conjecturing -- that this is purely an 'other' offense.   I certainly
didn't read it that way, but it _did_ bother me that he did not
include some of the examples I listed, or as Damien? mentioned on an
earlier post, the whole collective fantasy of capitalism.GLM> Call it gay-bashing or whatever, it's convenient tunnel-vision and

  You're assuming too much, dearie.  His was all a psychological game.
I'd be willing to wager that, his point was merely psychological.
That there is a distinguishing characteristic (the fantasy) about
those who are perpetually deluded into a preconceived notion of how
the world needs to work -- his examples were very clear -- a
psychopathological individual and on a lesser extreme, the father who
fantasizes his son as a football player.   I kinda read 'levels' into
that distinguishing characteristic though.   Meaning, just because
you believe in the/a fantasy, does not mean necessarily that you're
going to be an evil terrorist.   It just means you're playing alittle
game in your head, and because of that you are a bit different from
the rest of the wavelengths floating around in the cosmos at that
moment.GLM> ""Make no mistake about it"" it oozes rhetorical vehicles to obfuscate
GLM> it's lack of bits paragraph after paragraph in pushing an agenda to
GLM> /excuse/ ""our"" violence and suspension of human rights to 'clense'
GLM> ourselves of ""them"", the 'non-human' (or lesser-human) objects of its
GLM> hate.
I didn't read cleanse or nonhuman anywhere.   Mind telling me where
you saw those words?   Sure, I'll bite that the article had rhetoric.
I'll also bite that he wasn't fair entirely with his theory.   If he
meant it to be a universal (capable of including even the common
father with a football complex dream) he should have included our
delusions in all of this.   But honestly, where in the hell did you
get 'cleanse ourselves of 'them', the 'non-human' (or lesser-human)
objects... ?GLM> What else shall we call it?  Just anti-liberal?  Lots of things can be anti-liberal and not be bad.  :)GLM> Better question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour
GLM> are the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact
GLM> more like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? Well, as sinister as the schoolboard is, they didn't go kill 4k+
people.   Lets put some of this moral relativism de jour into
perspective here.   Al'Qaeda had a fantasy.  This fantasy involved a
whole mess of 'others' not in their collective fantasy.   This _is_
much like the mafia's collective fantasy about brotherhood and
organized crime, or the biker gang's fantasy about being badasses on
the road or the school board's fantasy about indoctrinating your
children with Jesus, but its not equivalent.The terrorists went out, and purposely destroyed things, and killed
people.   This is bad, I don't care what universe you're in.   While
the aspect of 'fantasy' can be applied to all groups, and that label
can be equivalent, the perpetration of the fantasy has different
effects and must be judged differently.   Otherwise, whats a genocide?
Just a father-son complex gone terribly awry?GLM> What if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima
GLM> gratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this
GLM> planet?  They just may, that doesn't dispute that their fantasy was a deadly
one.GLM> What if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like
GLM> our own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for
GLM> trade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make
GLM> it all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/
GLM> /identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs ""fundamentalist islam"",
GLM> and they call ours ""imperialist satanism""?GLM> When both sides can call the other ""evil"" to the cheers of their local
GLM> public and media, you can bet something's rotten in the state of Denmark.So your whole point is we too live in a fantasy.  Sure.   No
questions.  Its the thing that bothered me about the article.   I
think the difference between our fantasy and theirs, is that there are
folks out there, in our fantasy allowed to voice their opinons about
the 'fantasy' and keep folks a bit grounded in the real versus the
made-up.   From what I gather, there are no such guards, or
protections on their end.   Thats the problem with some regeimes over
others.   THey all have bad points -- Ours is in a collective fantasy
that we need to control the oil, masking the intentions behind a very
clever, albiet convienent other fantasy of 'terrorism'.   Point is,
Gary, the 'terrorism' fantasy really happened.  People really died.
I won't argue we're innocent in the perpetration of our fantasy, but
I'll argue that we're not just blindly 'cleansing' 'non-humans'.GLM> I guess that's why I live in the woods.  Bears and racoons I
GLM> understand, but I really just don't 'get' people.Too bad bears and racoons don't protect you from the silly fantasies
of people, yours or others.

day workshop on interactions in virtual reality ( vr ) environments . anyone dealing with theoretical , empirical , computational , experimental , sociological and anthropological aspects of vr environments that are either purely artificial or use real world characteristics is invited to participate in this workshop . in this workshop the emphasis is on vr environments that provide means for interacting with the objects in the environment , with embedded information sources and services ( possibly represented as agents ) or with other users and visitors of the environment . motivation in recent years we have seen that the computer science and the cognitive ergonomics communities have discovered and are exploring the possibilities of vr in user interfaces . in order to visualize available information and to provide users access to this information , virtual environments have been built such that users can find and explore information , communicate with other users and can communicate with objects and agents in the virtual worlds . this workshop emphasizes the role of vr in interfaces and in environments in which people share knowledge and experience and in which new forms of interactivity will emerge . in particular we want to explore the role of speech and language in virtual environments . how can we navigate in vr using speech and language , how can we model multimodal access to such environments , how can we communicate with other humans and with artificial agents in the vr environment , etc . the workshop is organized in the context of the u -

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately"

"" the number of class members will be huge , "" says maurice pesso , a lawyer at a new york firm that has filed a claim . there are , however , limits to the company ' s liability . it has already restated its results going back five years , but federal law restricts litigation to the past three . moreover , enron will not take the rap alone . its auditor , arthur andersen ( now plain andersen ) , is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed . the litigation comes after a rough decade for andersen . it has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as waste management , sunbeam and discovery zone . because enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm , it became much like an unregulated bank . the lack of supervision meant that the role of the company ' s auditor was crucial . andersen was certainly paid as if it was . in 2000 , it collected $ 25 m for auditing enron ' s books and another $ 27 m for consulting services . now how do you account for that ? copyright ? 2000 dow jones section c did ken lay understand what was happening at enron ? by floyd norris 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 1 , column 2 c . 2001 new york times company what a tangled web was weaved by enron . both investors and managers seem to have been misled . ' ' enron became overleveraged , ' ' kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , said this week , adding that things went wrong in ways that ' ' i could not have ever contemplated . ' ' he pointed to investments that ' ' performed far worse than we ever could have imagined . ' ' that was the first time that enron had admitted it had a leverage problem , and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others . mr . lay says he understood what was going on , but i suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by enron ' s soothing financial statements . when enron was riding high , it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants . mr . lay and other executives sold stock , but the company did not . just a month ago , mr . lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company ' s continuing earnings were . the leverage was not easy to find . a lot of it was carried off enron ' s balance sheet . partnerships and special - purpose entities that enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to enron . enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock . as undisclosed losses built up in those entities , it became more likely they could not pay their bills , leaving enron to do so . it is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand enron ' s plight until the last couple of weeks . when they figured it out , it took a $ 1 . 5 billion equity infusion that is part of the dynegy takeover to keep enron ' s rating above junk level . now enron has a board committee investigating various transactions , and promises to release details as they are uncovered . officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time , and perhaps they are . jeffrey skilling , mr . lay ' s protege , was enron ' s chief financial engineer until he quit this summer . and enron ' s chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as enron unraveled . some investors would say none of that matters now , that the only important fact is that dynegy is buying enron anyway . chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive , is convinced that enron ' s energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price dynegy is paying . he figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained . the big question now may be whether mr . watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study enron ' s trading positions . enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions - - positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet - - but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies . if big surprises are found , dynegy could back out of the deal . there is plenty of blame to go around here , and suits have been filed against enron , its current and former officials , and its auditor , arthur andersen . but investors also bear responsibility . enron ' s financial statements were , as mr . lay conceded this week , ' ' opaque and difficult to understand . ' ' investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on . they bought anyway . enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers . an old - line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world . investors did not care how enron made the numbers . now , when it is too late , they do . graph tracks the monthly closes of enron ' s stock price from 1998 through 2001 . yesterday ' s close : $ 9 . 48 copyright ? 2000 dow jones section a a quick change in fortune dulls the glimmer of houston by jim yardley 11 / 16 / 2001 the new york times page 14 , column 1 c . 2001 new york times company houston , nov . 15 - - on a day when oil prices plunged to two - year lows , when the hometown enron corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch , george alcorn lunched on chilean sea bass at the downtown petroleum club and decided that the sky was not falling . ' ' i ' ve been an optimist all my life , ' ' said mr . alcorn , 69 , who owns an independent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid - 1980 ' s . ' ' the opportunities in this town have always been large . i don ' t think it ' s going to change at all . ' ' that mr . alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism . until recently , economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass houston , the nation ' s energy capital . in june , the economist magazine , citing houston ' s increasingly diverse economy , even promoted it as a candidate for the world ' s next great international city and business center . but june is a long time ago . by then , the city had already lost 2 , 000 jobs from the struggling computer maker compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company ' s merger with hewlett - packard is approved . in the aftermath of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , continental airlines , which is based here , announced 12 , 000 layoffs , some likely to come in houston . the texas medical center , one of the largest medical complexes in the world , is facing financial peril after flooding in june caused an estimated $ 2 billion in damages . the latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of enron , the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival , dynegy , was announced last week . even if the merger goes through , the city is expected to feel a crunch ; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction , including one by enron . one visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city ' s sports stadiums , enron field and compaq center , are named for companies that soon may not exist . this week , the national association of purchasing management , which measures business activity and industrial production , released a report showing that houston ' s economy had contracted in october after 32 consecutive months of expansion . ' ' over the first half of this year , you had to feel pretty good , ' ' said bill gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas and an authority on houston . but mr . gilmer said that much of the city ' s recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was ' ' running out of steam . ' ' ' ' the national economy , ' ' mr . gilmer added , ' ' is not helping out right now . ' ' the fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on houston is , oddly enough , evidence of the city ' s success in recovering from the 1980 ' s oil bust . then , with the local economy dominated by oil and gas , the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification . and it worked : compaq , continental , the texas medical center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped houston recover and grow even faster , becoming the nation ' s fourth - largest city . the new generation of sophisticated energy companies , led by enron , then created a boom . economists say the next several months are likely to be slow . there could be substantial layoffs if compaq and enron mergers take place . mr . gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city ' s economy ; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1 , 000 from about 1 , 300 in recent months . yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust , when downtown office buildings stood practically empty . instead , economists point to a relatively quick rebound . ray perryman , a texas economist who runs the perryman group , said houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities , including the city ' s bustling port , the nation ' s second largest . the city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the american entry to be host of the 2012 olympic games . voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line , and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution . ' ' we ' re sitting here with over two million jobs , ' ' said former mayor bob lanier . the downfall of enron , though , a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress , has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city ' s economy . the company had embodied the self - image that houston business leaders hold dear : it was entrepreneurial , aggressive and ground breaking . it was also a generous civic benefactor ; the company ' s chairman , kenneth l . lay , a close friend of president bush , had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate . but this week , enron ' s lost glory became painfully evident . in a hall at rice university on tuesday , mr . lay presented alan greenspan , the federal reserve chairman , with a lifetime achievement award , the enron prize , which mr . lay ' s company had endowed and named in flush times . the next morning , an article in the houston chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed . photos : compaq center , home of the n . b . a . houston rockets , is named for a company that soon may not exist . enron , above , may soon be acquired by a rival energy company .

( operating cash flow at cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization . ) insurance will cover some of the cost of the johnson - longley payouts . ' ' the team looks healthy , ' ' jim dolan , the president of cablevision , said on tuesday during a conference call with analysts . ' ' i don ' t expect any more write - offs . ' ' whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career - ending injury . but cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of johnson and longley . in each case , the garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods . in his second season in charlotte , johnson hurt his back , and he has never been the same . maybe the garden was swayed that he was well enough , because he averaged 20 . 5 points and 8 . 4 rebounds in the season before it traded anthony mason for him . but the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place . the back compromised his skills , often limiting him to being a symbol of the knicks ' grit . he also spelled ' ' l ' ' with his bended arm quite nicely , yet not worth an average of $ 7 million a year . when longley arrived from phoenix last year in the four - team deal that sent patrick ewing to seattle , he said he had told the knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition . ' ' i brought up my ankle in my physical with the knicks , ' ' he said in july , ' ' and they said , ' have you been playing ? ' i said , ' yes , ' and that was it . ' ' the fact was , he played for the australian olympic team in sydney last year , but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing . should have been a tip - off . the naming rights dance enron field , home of the houston home run , is bound to be called something different next season when jimy williams starts his tenure as the astros ' manager . enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , agreed to pay $ 100 million to put its name on the ballpark for 30 years , a deal that began last year . but enron is in trouble . it has lost nearly $ 60 billion in its market value ; the company recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by nearly $ 600 million and it agreed to be acquired by dynergy for $ 9 billion . in another part of houston , the compaq center could take on another name now that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 ( at $ 900 , 000 annually for six years ) is planning to merge with hewlett - packard . in 2003 , the rockets will move to a new arena . named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before . a takeover turned philadelphia ' s comcast center into the first union center . the twa dome in st . louis is now the dome at america ' s center to reflect twa ' s purchase by american airlines . marine midland arena in buffalo now has hsbc ' s name . meanwhile , pro player stadium near miami is named for a defunct division of the bankrupt fruit of the loom . two other n . f . l . stadiums , one being built , the other three years old , are named for ailing companies . in foxboro , mass . , cmgi field is being readied for play next season by the new england patriots . in the 12 months ended july 31 , cmgi , an internet development company , lost $ 4 . 4 billion ( twice the annual network tv payments to the n . f . l . ) . cmgi will pay $ 114 million over 15 years for its naming deal - - if it lasts that long . psinet , an internet communications services provider that is paying $ 105 . 5 million over 20 years to be the name atop the baltimore ravens ' stadium , filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $ 3 . 2 billion in the quarter ending march 31 . the conseco fieldhouse in indiana , the home of the pacers , is named for a finance and insurance company that recently posted a $ 410 million quarterly loss . the financial state of some airlines since sept . 11 may affect some of the arenas and stadiums named for them . besides the dome in st . louis , six other facilities are named for airlines ( two for american ) . last year , the canadian airlines saddledome , where the calgary flames play , changed its name when its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by air canada . now it is the pengrowth saddledome . copyright ? 2000 dow jones fleeing investors have bid the stock down about 90 % from its high last fall . 4 . a blodget blunder ? speaking of folks who lost money for investors , analyst henry blodget is taking part in a buyout at merrill lynch , reportedly exiting the firm with a severance package of about $ 2 million . ( bwah - ha - ha - ha - ha . ) blodget won notoriety for talking up the prospects of many internet issues that later went belly - up or were acquired on the cheap , including such resounding losers as pets . com , psinet and ubid . last summer one irate investor , claiming he ' d lost half a million dollars by taking blodget ' s advice , extracted $ 400 , 000 in compensation from merrill lynch . but despite the lousy stock calls , in retrospect blodget looks pretty smart . he cultivated a momentarily outsized ( if short - lived ) cult of personality - - worth doing once during a lifetime , in our humble opinion - - and secured a tidy payout on the way out the door . we note his exit from the scene not because he was dumb , but because his passage represents the end of an ignominiously silly era - - one in which ordinary investors tossed money into dubious ideas ( like pets . com ) , then were ungraceful enough to complain they ' d gotten bad advice . there ' s no question analysts may have meted out absurdly bullish stock forecasts . the bigger problem is that investors , suckered by the potential of outlandish profits , acted like they believed them . 5 . unflagging american opportunists while we salute the unflagging american entrepreneurial spirit , we note that it also can metamorphose into enthusiastic fraud . such was the case with three opportunists flagged by the sec this week : companies claiming to have products that protect against bioterrorism . most inventive of the three was from r - tec technologies ( rttc . ob : otc bb - news - commentary ) , which claimed to have developed a "" chemical and biological alarm and neutralization defense system , "" or in trumped - up military lingo , "" c - band .

"" calgary - - six powerhouse u . s . players are joining transcanada pipelines ltd . and westcoast energy inc . in an attempt to inject new momentum into a bid to build a multibillion - dollar pipeline from alaska . the partnership , which includes energy services and transportation giants williams cos . , duke energy corp . , enron corp . , as well as major utilities el paso corp . , pg & e corp . and sempra energy utilities ventures , have agreed to work together with transcanada and westcoast to put a proposal before the alaska gas producers before the end of the year . the group , which laid out its intentions in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday , said they believe a gas pipeline running along the alaska highway can be built by 2008 . murray birch , senior vice - president of westcoast , said the partners lend expertise , deep pockets and scale to the mammoth project , which is estimated to cost well over $ 10 - billion ( u . s . ) . "" it ' s in our best interest to involve them . this project is a large project , and certainly westcoast and transcanada would have been stretched to do it by ourselves , "" said mr . birch , who is also the co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines ltd . a joint venture co - owned by westcoast and transcanada . foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed alaska highway pipeline . mr . birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still to be worked out . rocco cianco , a foothills spokesman , said that is in part because some of the companies are in a state of flux . westcoast is in the process of being taken over by duke , while houston - based enron is in the process of being bought by hometown rival dynegy corp . the partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participants in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970 s and shelved because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition . mr . birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipeline project , of whether the six u . s . companies had any claim on the project based on their capital investment in the 1970 s project . they withdrew from that project on the understanding that if it was to restart , they would be able to recover that initial investment , which some have pegged at up to $ 4 - billion including interest , he said . in getting back on board , the six companies have agreed to waive that claim , he said . scott kent , the minister of economic development for yukon , a vocal proponent of the proposed pipeline , said the removal of the legal question lifts a huge barrier to the project . "" there was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that would have significantly hampered "" the project , he said . "" it ' s certainly very good news . "" winfried fruehauf , an analyst at national bank financial in toronto , said the six u . s . companies as well as westcoast , transcanada and foothills are trying to make sure they ' re first in line to move the gas from burgeoning alaskan fields to market . "" everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline , there ' s so many ' me toos ' that they just want to position themselves , "" he said . the market understanding is that the alaska producers , which include exxon mobil corp . , phillips petroleum co . , bp amoco plc and chevron corp . , will ultimately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of such a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls . gina taylor , a spokeswoman for enron , said the partners got together with an eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the project can go ahead . "" marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this , "" she said . "" that ' s why we put the [ memorandum ] in place , so we could go out and revisit with the producers . "" but curtis thayer , a spokesman for the alaska producers , said it is too early to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline , because his group has not even decided to proceed with one yet . he noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $ 100 - million study the group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn ' t pay for itself at current commodity prices . however , no decision has been made , he insisted . some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north shore of alaska and yukon to gas fields in the northwest territories , then down the mackenzie valley of the nwt , or a pipeline going over land in yukon to the nwt . there are various backers for each proposal and the alaskan producers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves . joe handley , the minister of finance for the nwt , said news of the partnership is a spur to participants in the proposed mackenzie valley pipeline . the territory ' s government has consistently said an nwt pipeline must be built first or risk being derailed by an alaska pipeline that would flood the market with product . "" if we don ' t keep on our toes , [ an alaska pipeline ] could pass us and leave us in the bush , "" he said . foothills announced earlier this week that it reached a preliminary agreement with the kaska nation , removing another potential hurdle to the alaska pipeline proposal . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . nov . 16 , 2001 houston chronicle new power faults data flow but opposes program delay by laura goldberg copyright 2001 houston chronicle the new power co . , a major player in the state ' s test pilot of electricity deregulation , said thursday that problems getting data from other entities have caused it to send out customer bills late and without all the appropriate charges . but new power , an electricity provider , is hopeful problems can be resolved and doesn ' t believe the state should delay the planned jan . 1 start of electricity deregulation . delays and computer glitches have plagued the pilot program , which let a limited number of consumers across the state choose power providers before the opening of the full market . new power and other electricity companies made comments thursday in filings with the public utility commission . the puc will use them as it evaluates whether to move forward on jan . 1 . several other companies also cited some ongoing problems . new power , which enrolled more than 61 , 000 customers in the pilot , said a majority of its customers are getting late bills and that it has issued initial customer bills for lower amounts than what ' s due . before new power can issue accurate bills , it needs information from separate companies that maintain electricity transmission and metering systems . that information is sent to new power through the electric reliability council of texas , which runs a variety of computer systems need for deregulation . a new power spokeswoman said executives have met with the companies and ercot about the problem and the situation seems to be improving . reliant resources , the houston parent of electricity provider reliant energy retail services , said in its filing that it is "" confident that any remaining significant issues will be overcome "" in time to open the market jan . 1 . near the end of last month , nine retail electricity providers told the puc they opposed delaying the planned start date of deregulation . a coalition of consumer groups has called for a delay , saying the state isn ' t ready for a variety of reasons . but the electricity companies , which included reliant and new power , said the market shortcomings the consumer groups cited either don ' t exist or can be fixed and don ' t require a delay . consortium ' s return sparks renewed hope in gas pipeline project by mike chambers associated press writer 11 / 15 / 2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . juneau ( ap ) - a natural gas consortium plans to resurrect its proposal to build a 1 , 700 - mile gas pipeline through alaska to the lower 48 , sparking renewed hope in the massive undertaking just as oil companies were doubting its viability . the nine american and canadian companies announced plans on thursday to offer to build and maintain the pipeline in an effort to ship 36 trillion cubic feet of north slope natural gas . the group intends to make a proposal to the three major oil companies by december , a spokesman for the consortium said . "" the economic benefits of this multi - billion dollar project would impact most regions of the u . s . and canada , "" said mike stewart , co - chief executive officer of foothills pipe lines . foothills reached the agreement with transcanada pipelines , westcoast energy and american companies williams , duke energy , el paso corp . , enron , pg & e corp . and sempra energy international . the groups comprise the original alaskan northwest natural gas transportation company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970 s . under the terms of the agreement , the companies plan to dismiss $ 4 billion in costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have been charged to developers of the pipeline . the money represents their original investment , with interest . "" their intention is to remove that as an issue , "" said foothills spokesman rocco ciancio . that was seen as a key roadblock to building an all - alaska pipeline to the lower 48 by officials with the state , which would own 12 . 5 percent of any natural gas pumped out of the north slope . "" now that that ' s been resolved , it ' s time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies , the state of alaska and other players to get this project underway , "" said gov . tony knowles . exxon mobil , phillips and bp have spent millions studying the viability of the project and , so far , have determined it is not profitable . knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to build a route that generally follows the trans - alaska oil pipeline and the alaska highway to alberta . it would provide jobs for alaskans , cheap natural gas to communities and revenues for state services , knowles said . but canadian officials have pushed for a beaufort sea route that taps into rich reserves stranded in the mackenzie delta . the oil companies estimate the canadian route would cost $ 15 . 1 billion compared to the alaska highway route , which would cost $ 17 billion . ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $ 9 . 7 billion to construct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals . the consortium has held permits to build the all - alaska route since 1976 . "" we ' re estimating it would take a greenfield ( start up ) project somewhere near two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project , "" ciancio said . the consortium ' s project proposes running a 42 - inch pipe from prudhoe bay to alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to chicago and san francisco , he said . if agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies , the pipeline could be in operation by 2008 , ciancio said . a spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitable .

"" i know ( traders ) are getting a ton of calls , but i don ' t think there is going to be a mass exodus from the trading floor , "" said joe baker , president of houston - based search consultants international , a recruitment company that serves the energy and power marketing industry . enron , known for turning out some of the industry ' s most aggressive traders , also has a reputation as a tough training ground for newcomers , handsomely rewarding those who "" make their numbers "" and quickly showing non - performers the door . traders at other energy firms said experienced traders can earn six - figures salaries before annual bonuses , paid sometime between the beginning of january and the middle of march . a company recruiting traders before the bonus is paid would have to pay a larger sign on bonus . "" the majority of the key traders are going to wait and see what kind of situation develops . . . everyone ' s got their eyes open , "" baker said . "" most people want to stick around to see what kind of bonus they are going to get . "" wait and see energy traders are clearly worried about the $ 9 billion takeover announced last week , an opportunity for dynegy to chop head count . "" there ' s a lot of overlap at both firms . i don ' t think there will be enough room for everyone , "" a trader at another texas - based energy firm said . enron is the nation ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity . dynegy is about a fifth as big as enron measured in terms of revenue . despite the job uncertainty hanging over their heads , traders said they could not name a single enron or dynegy trader actively scouting out a new employer . "" everyone seems to be waiting to see what happens . there are only a few trader jobs open in the country right now . those positions will likely be filled pretty quickly if this merger goes through , "" another trader said .

"" arbs who think a deal will eventually be completed may "" short "" the acquirer and buy target stock , reasoning that the acquirer ' s stock will fall and the target will rise on completion . but in recent days , enron ' s stock has languished , while dynegy ' s stock has gained more than 40 percent , although it was close to the same level a month ago . some arbs said dynegy ' s stock may have risen because it could gain valuable pipeline assets whether or not a deal is completed . enron said it granted dynegy an option to buy its northern natural gas pipeline system for less than $ 975 million if the deal falls apart after the months - long due diligence review . "" now dynegy has up to a year to look at the company and at worst , dynegy comes away with a very good deal , "" said one arb .

"" we fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence . we are fully committed to fixing the problems , "" he said . lay ' s act of atonement came after enron said he had decided to waive his right to a $ 60 million golden parachute as part of dynegy ' s planned buyout , following a tense exchange with employees about his severance package on tuesday . lay received a base salary of $ 1 . 3 million from enron for 2000 plus bonuses totaling $ 10 . 6 million . he has also made several million dollars this year by exercising options and selling enron stock at prices which mostly ranged from $ 40 to $ 60 , according to enron filings . ubs warburg analyst ron barone said lay ' s candor could not undo damage already done but was welcome nevertheless .

"" in hindsight , we made some very bad investments in non - core businesses , "" lay said in a 90 - minute conference call . many of those investments , such as an ill - fated venture into the water services business and a power plant project in india that became mired in a payments dispute , performed below enron ' s worst expectations , lay said . "" the negative impact of these investments have been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet , "" lay said . deals between enron and partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow , produced "" various conflicts of interest , both real and perceived , "" he added . fastow was recently replaced and the deals with the partnerships are now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission . lay , who built enron into the dominant energy trading company in north america and europe after it was formed by the merger of two natural gas pipeline companies in 1986 , said the core wholesale energy businesses were fundamentally sound . in the short term , he said , enron will focus on preventing further deterioration of its credit ratings and maintaining sufficient liquidity to keep the energy businesses running . enron ' s president and chief operating officer , greg whalley , said the company expects its recent woes to have a "" temporary but negative impact "" on profitability . whalley told analysts and investors that fourth - quarter results would also be adversely affected by severance costs and other restructuring costs . he did not provide details but said enron will issue earnings guidance in two to three weeks . the reference to severance costs was the first allusion to job cuts that are widely viewed as inevitable . enron also said it is seeking an additional $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in private equity to help rebuild confidence in the company and keep its core trading operations afloat in the nine months before the acquisition by dynegy is expected to close . it has already received $ 1 . 5 billion in cash from oil company chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 . 5 percent of dynegy . enron has been under heavy fire from wall street since mid - october when it said shareholder equity had been cut by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals with the fastow partnerships . dynegy has said that its agreement with enron would allow it to back out of the acquisition if the company ' s problems , which include a stack of lawsuits from angry investors , turn out to be far worse than has already been disclosed . however , dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson has said he is confident this will not happen . watson will head the combined company , which will retain the dynegy name , and dynegy will dominate the combined company ' s senior management and board of directors . lay has said he has not yet made up his mind whether to accept watson ' s offer of a seat on the board of the new company . the california public employees retirement system ( calpers ) , the largest u . s . pension fund , said there should be no place for lay or any other enron directors on the new dynegy board .

( ene ) tuesday with the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies ' merger agreement , a dynegy spokeswoman said . dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline in return for its investment . the cash infusion , which was made with the assistance of dynegy ' s largest shareholder , chevrontexaco corp . ( cvx ) , is aimed at providing enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations . the rights provide dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger . the deal , which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval , is expected to close within the next six to nine months . dynegy is acquiring enron for 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share , or about $ 10 billion based on the recent price of dynegy shares . the acquisition of enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers . the dealings are under investigation by the securities and exchange commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits . during the last month , enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated . as credit - rating agencies began to cut enron ' s debt ratings threatening the company ' s investment - grade status , the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business . industry experts viewed dynegy ' s cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader ' s liquidity , and protect its most valuable business . in a conference call earlier wednesday , enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events . according to dynegy spokeswoman jennifer rosser , the preferred stock dynegy has received for its investment in enron is convertible into the common stock of the enron pipeline unit . dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into enron shares if it desires , the spokeswoman said . for example , if enron were to cancel its merger with dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor , dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in enron ' s stock price , rosser said . in either case , dynegy wouldn ' t be required to pay any additional consideration . dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after chevrontexaco , of san francisco , made an investment in dynegy . if the acquisition closes as anticipated , chevrontexaco , which owns about one - fourth of dynegy , plans to make an additional $ 1 billion investment in the combined company . chevrontexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition . enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market ' s reaction to the cash infusion , and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties . enron remains on a credit watch at the credit - rating agencies . moody ' s investors service and standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . usa : enron queried by epa on oil pipeline spills . 11 / 14 / 2001 reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . washington , nov 14 ( reuters ) - the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron corp . , already reeling from bad investments , too much debt and possible conflicts of interest , said on wednesday that the government is seeking information on spills from pipelines operated by enron and its subsidiaries . in a filing with the securities and exchange commission , the houston - based company said it received a request for information from the environmental protection agency regarding certain spills and discharges since 1998 on oil pipelines operated by enron and its subsidiaries . eott energy partners llp is the only subsidiary of enron that has extensive domestic oil pipeline operations , according to the filing . enron ' s response was originally supposed to be filed with the epa no later than nov . 7 , but it received an extension until jan . 31 .

( psi ) . fitch rates the senior secured debt of both ' a - . ' the negative outlook reflects the rise in debt leverage due mainly to the acquisition of two natural gas fired generating units from enron corp in march 2001 . as of sept . 30 , 2001 , debt was 63 % of total capitalization , up from 59 % and 56 % at the end of fiscal years 2000 and 1999 , respectively . the acquisition consists of enron ' s 494 - megawatt brownsville generation facility located in haywood county , tennessee and the 504 - megawatt caledonia generation facility located in lowndes county , mississippi . to reduce leverage , cin plans to use proceeds from non - core asset sales to reduce debt and to reinstitute the issuance of new shares to meet obligations under its dividend reinvestment plan and various employee stock plans . if the debt reduction is successful , the outlook could return to stable . capital requirements related to cin ' s compliance with environmental regulations are also a concern . in september 2000 , cin announced a plan for its subsidiaries to spend about $ 800 million system wide over the following five years to install pollution control equipment to reduce nox emissions . a majority of these expenditures will be incurred by psi , the regulated integrated utility , and should be recovered through rates . the company also reached a tentative agreement with the environmental protection agency and other parties to reduce so 2 emissions by shutting down or re - powering with natural gas several coal - fired boilers and installing scrubbers and pollution control systems at several sites . the agreement , if finalized , would require cin to spend an additional $ 700 million , mostly during 2008 - 2013 . cin ' s ratings also take into account the significant earnings and cash flow contribution of its regulated utility businesses , and a revised business strategy for its non - regulated businesses that is less aggressive and more appropriate for this mid - size company . the new strategy emphasizes regional , asset - based energy trading and marketing , customer led origination , and its regulated utility operations . a large amount of cin ' s non - regulated revenue will be derived from contractual sales with its subsidiaries , cge and the union light , heat and power company . cge ' s electric restructuring plan provides substantial transition cost recovery and allows the company to transfer its generating facilities . cge plans to transfer its generating assets to cin ' s non - regulated affiliate , cinergy wholesale energy , inc . another cin subsidiary , psi , remains a vertically integrated regulated company and restructuring is not expected in the mid - term . regulated operations provide about 55 % of earnings . cin , through its subsidiaries cge and psi , provides electric and gas service in ohio , kentucky and indiana to about 1 . 5 million electric and 500 , 000 gas customers . the company also has a growing merchant energy business and owns 13 , 000 megawatts of generation . contact : fitch , new york orli almog , 212 / 908 - 0894 or robert hornick , 212 / 908 - 0523 14 : 48 est november 14 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved ."

Yup I'm running it on my k6 233 laptop. It's tres sweet.I would recommend getting wvdial, opening a virtual terminal dialing the internet and then emerging the packages you need.I did my install over my home lan and the lan in work (which has DSL - running Linux as firewall/router/mailserver of course).But yes you will need at least wvdial to make this puppy happen me thinks.In fact it looks as if the base install comes with wvdial for just this kind of instal.But I just found this on the Gentoo site for you.
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?t=4691&highlight=modemSpecificallyquote:
If it is not too obvious, these are the steps I took.
    * Boot off the install CD
    * modprobe serial
    * setserial (if needed)
    * create mount point for other distribution
    * mount other distribution
    * chroot'd to other distribution
    * su - to regular user
    * ran wvdial
    * switch consoles and install as normal
And yes I do give better technical support to people who use
distros I like.I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.

( birgitta englund dimitrova mentions that this article has ever since been widely quoted in research on translation . ) the context is the division of labor between lexical and grammatical means , which may vary considerably from language to language , and the problems this poses for translation : "" if some grammatical category is absent in a given language , its meaning may be translated into this language by lexical means . . . . it is more difficult to remain faithful to the original when we translate into a language provided with a certain grammatical category from a language devoid of such a category . . . . as boas neatly observed , the grammatical pattern of a language ( as opposed to its lexical stock ) determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed in the given language . . . . in order to translate accurately the english sentence "" i hired a worker , "" a russian needs supplementary information , whether this action was completed or not and whether the worker was a man or a woman . . . ) languages differ essentially in what they _ must _ convey and not in what they ) > _ may _ convey . each verb of a given language imperatively raises a set of specific yes-no - questions . . .

' a paucity of obligatory aspects does not by any means imply obscurity of speech . when necessary , clarity can be obtained by adding explanatory words .

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

1,"DEAR SIR,I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.Best personal regards,MRS MARIAM ABACHA.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--

of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)Nick--

0,"california update 5 / 4 / 01 if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 . bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult . the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward . currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments ."

for deep infrasound (pressure waves) with a network of stations designed 
to enforced the nuke test ban treaty we've discovered that pretty big 
impacts are the norm. Current infrasound stations can detect 
bolides/meteoroids in ~10 T TNT scale, but some 10 kT events are 
relatively frequent. A number of people died in the Tunguska event (1908, 
10-15 MT), despite it hitting in the middle of nowhere.http://216.239.39.100/search?q=cache:637JrhGDB5gC:www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/5thMars99/pdf/6081.pdf+bolide+impact+kT+wave&hl=en&ie=UTF-8In the Earth atmosphere a large number of bright light flashes of energies
in light impulse of about 0.1- 1 kt TNT and higher have been registered by
USA DoD satellites equipped with photoelectric detectors [9-11]. Intense
light impulses are created by impacts of meteoroids disrupted in the
atmosphere (mainly at altitudes of about 30-45 km). Several techniques for
the assessment of meteor- oid's characteristics from the light curves and
heights of peak intensities have been developed [3,12]. Using these
techniques the preatmospheric kinetic energy for Fifth International
Conference on Mars INITIATION OF SANDSTORMS: I.V.Nemtchinov, O.P.Popova,
V.A.Rybakov, V.V.Shuvalov a number of events was determined. The biggest
event is the 1 February 1994 with ini- tial energy as high as 30-40 kt TNT
(or initial mass of about 400 t). The bright flash with light energy of
about 4.5 kt TNT was caused by this meteoroid which deeply penetrated into
the atmosphere (at an angle of 45 degrees and velocity of 24 km/s) and
disintegrated above at altitudes of about 34 km and 21 km [9,12]. Another
famous impact event, the Sikhote-Alin meteor shower (12 February 1947
event), may be compared with the 1 February 1994 event. Initial masses of
these meteoroids are probably the same, as well as the angle of trajectory
inclination, but the initial velocity of the Sikhote-Alin is almost twice
smaller. That caused fragmentation of 1 February 1994 meteoroid at higher
altitudes and probably large fragments constitute a smaller part of the
pre- breakdown mass in contrast to the Sikhote-Alin event. In a rarefied
atmosphere of Mars analogous im- pactors will penetrate into deeper layers
of the atmos- phere.They will disintegrate lower 15 km or even reach the
planet surface, partially in disrupted form. Only the first disruption
would occur if a meteoroid similar to that caused the 1 February 1994 will
enter into the Martian atmosphere. And this body would reach the Mars
surface as a tense swarm of fragments. The meteoroid similar to that
caused the Sikhote-Alin event would hit the surface in a form of large
frag- ments due to its low velocity. They will create crater with the size
similar to that of the undisrupted meteoroid.

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ETWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points."""

feeling
by Lester HainesThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html
'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience.The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional
response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The
tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger
against ragheads, thus:Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has
adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political
opponents.Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm
hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of
Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people:She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her
instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly
missed.The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and
self-indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset
about the death of a complete stranger.Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any
government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately
transparent:Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling
him ""the most honest man it has been my privilege to know"".And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified
the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within
it complete immunity from prosecution:Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug-addicted
perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling
and obnoxious behaviour.The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C
has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has
further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the
effect on the reader could be catastrophic:In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen
victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme,
Stephen Byers noted: ""She was everybody's favourite grandmother who
touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from
this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by
next Monday. And you can quote me on that.""http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork

0,"thestreet . com : trade winds blowing enron further south trade winds blowing enron further south by peter eavis senior columnist 08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation . a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings . for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double . now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower . in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move . enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman . but skeptics remain unconvinced . "" i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , "" says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected . details , details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . ) enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . ) enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold . however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter . the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit . partners indeed the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently . the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line . the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results . then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as "" significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . "" some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels . skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ? in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million . put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ? an enron spokeswoman responds : "" eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . "" and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal . a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers . this person also says the gain was "" immaterial "" to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states . whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . "" they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , "" concludes off wall street ' s roberts . know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com . in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships ."
0,"fw : summary rto week day 2 - - planning & expansion fyi . tj and claudette - - please forward to your groups . thanks . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : walton , steve sent : wednesday , october 17 , 2001 10 : 17 pm rto week day 2 - - october 16 , 2001 transmission planning & expansion the afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion . the panelists were : jose degado - - ceo american transmission company , michael dworkin - - chair vermont psc , mark maher - - vp transmission business line , bonneville power administration , lara manz - - pse & g , masheed rosenqvist - - national grid , steve walton - - enron . general observations the commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time . commissioner ' s breathitt and massey were the most active in questioning . the ferc staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations , moving along the discussion by asking questions . there was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management , however , there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights . there was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the rto planning process being first a provider of information to the market ( where are problems , how might they be solved , etc . ) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit . there was a good deal of discussion of "" least cost planning "" and the identification of options which are not transmission related . all agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission , however then the challenge is who pays for it , which raises the need for dispute resolution . opening statements jose delgado : atc is a transmission only company with miso as the system operator . they view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met . they were formed by divestiture by ious , coops and munis and with a $ 500 million asset base initially . their current ten year plan will add $ 1 billion of investment . their top priorities are connecting generation and load . michael dworkin : because transmission is a common good , construction affects all parties not just one party . the environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view . the idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi - state projects , although ferc has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by fcc . state input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered . mark maher : ferc must consider the unique characteristics of the west when considering congestion management . lmp is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations . rto west is developing a planning process which will give the rto the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future . the rto needs a strong centralized planning process . laura manz : the various aspects of planning are connected . pricing ( lmp ) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources . no competitor should have an advantage over another . the rto needs a central planning process but it shouldn ' t push solutions . the market should decide on solutions . masheed rosenqvist : the morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk . the planning discussion is not about what we have now , but about how to avoid future congestion . the commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases . the issues that need to be answered are : how can merchant transmission be compensated ? should transmission projects be open to rfps ? is ferc open to market based pricing for expansions ? steve walton : the most important thing for ferc to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment . the rto debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled . for expansion to go forward , there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party . you are always going to have muddy issues in planning . for instance if a 138 kv line is all that is needed to day , but future considerations of scare right - of - way say a 345 kv line should be built , who pays for the extra cost . in order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process , appeal able to ferc , to decide such matters . discussion kevin kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose . most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding . michael dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution , i . e . least cost planning . this lead to discussion of the need for the rto to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions . commissioner massey asked about whether the system was ( a ) under built and needed lots of expansion so don ' t worry about overbuilding or ( b ) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities . the panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process . michaela dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions . laura manz felt that the term "" under built "" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties . dick o ' neil asked if lmp will work in the west . mark maher said it wouldn ' t . laura manz said it applies everywhere because of physics , they manage hydro facilities in pjm . michael dworkin said lmp means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed . bpa is looking pricing model but lmp won ' t work . steve walton said lmp needed for real time dispatch , but given the nature of the northwest hydro system it must have some "" tweaks "" like bilaterals and allow operator self - schedule output levels to permit river coordination . hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis . pjm has hydro , but not 70 % as in the northwest . implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal . in the summation at the end of the panel , four principles were listed : ( 1 ) rto must provide information , ( 2 ) rto should identify solutions , ( 3 ) rto should be unbiased and ( 4 ) the rto should be accountable . the disagreement was over the last two points , michael dworkin felt that # 3 ( unbiased ) was critical and that # 4 ( accountability ) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance . jose delgado said and transco can ' t be unbiased since it provides services , although the iso above it can be , but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake . this last point really comes down to a preference for iso over transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues . steve"

What, are they illiterate? Mute? What's their problem? If somebody stops
them from posting web pages, or printing newsletters, or talking on the
phone, or organizing their /own/ conference then that would be wrong.I don't think free speech is a license to speak directly at and be in the
physical presence of any particular individual of your choosing - especially
when that individual is busy doing something else and isn't interested.

YOUR KIND ATTN.,RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this
mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal
and business ethics, I apologize in advance.I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I
represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzoâ€™s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief
security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the
advent of a new democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
severe persecution due to the sensitive position he
held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of
his village.The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a
business proposal that might be of interest to you. My
client has informed me of the existence of funds
deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were
allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure
as chief security adviser to the then president. What
happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this
security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
security outfit of the
then president. But before the purchase could take
place the president died. My client has decided to
keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his
incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the
change of possession to his benefit.I have been mandated by my client to source for a
foreign partner that can help him facilitate the
change of possession. The deposit certificate and the
code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in
my possession.The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand
United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor.I remain most obliged.Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).

The .NAME domain appears in the format: FirstName.LastName.NAME For example, if your name is Monica Smith, then you can register a name such as monica.smith.name Technology experts predict that personalized domain names will soon be used as international identifiers much the same was that phone numbers are used today.

Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, and possibly not even
that.  For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I
always thought ""not being stupid (most of the time)"" was a fairly low
bar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.That is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant
and/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a
key causal factor in why things are the way they are.  What are you
going to do about it?

( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous "" anti-spammers "" only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good ."
